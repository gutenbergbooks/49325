  <h2 class='c007'><span class='large'>A SKETCH<br /> <br />OF THE<br /> <br />LIFE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The middle of the last century was an evil time, in England, for literature and for
literary men. The period was eminently one of transition; and transition periods are
always times of trial to all whose interests they affect. The old system passes away,
bearing with it those who cling to it; the new system requires time until it is in
working order, and those who depend upon its advent for their subsistence are
sorely harassed while the turmoil lasts. Thus it was with literature at the time when
Goldsmith began to write. The age in which literary men depended upon patrons
had passed away. No more snug government berths, no more secretaryships, as in
the time of Addison and Prior and Steele—and the time when the public was to support
literature had not yet come.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus the author was compelled either to depend entirely on the booksellers,
or to sell his pen, in true hireling fashion, to the government of the day, or to the
opposition, and to scribble approval or invective at his master's dictation. Happily
for his own fame, happily for English literature, the author of the "Vicar of
Wakefield" chose the former alternative.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oliver Goldsmith was born at Pallas, or Pallasmore, county Longford, Ireland,
on the 10th of November, 1728. He was one of a numerous family, of whom he
alone attained celebrity. His father, the Rev. Charles Goldsmith, a clergyman
of the Established Church, was in very poor circumstances at the time of the birth of
his famous son; but little Oliver was only two years old when the sunshine of
prosperity descended upon his house, with what must have appeared to the inmates
quite a blaze of noonday splendour. The small income of forty pounds a-year, upon
which the Rev. Charles Goldsmith had managed painfully and penuriously to struggle
on with his family, was suddenly increased to two hundred, when the rectory of
Kilkenny-west was obtained by that fortunate divine; and the Goldsmiths removed
to Lissoy, near Athlone.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Rev. Charles Goldsmith seems to have possessed, in a very large degree,
certain traits of character by which all the Goldsmiths were more or less distinguished.
Almost culpably careless in worldly matters, his easy good-nature and kindly generous
disposition frequently made him the dupe of the designing and ungrateful. Himself
incapable of cunning and deceit, he imagined that all men were frank and open.
The last man in the world to take an unfair advantage of his neighbour, he never
suspected that any man could possibly take advantage of him. Goldsmith himself
<a id='Page_vii'></a>under the guise of the Man in Black, gives us an insight into affairs at the Rectory in
these early days. "My father's education," the Man in Black tells us, "was above
his fortune, and his generosity greater than his education." Then we hear of
numerous guests entertained at the hospitable parson's table, and paying for their
dinner by laughing at the host's oft-repeated jests and time-honoured anecdotes.
"He told the story of the ivy tree, and that was laughed at; he repeated the jest of
the two scholars and one pair of breeches, and the company laughed at that; but
the story of Taffy in the sedan chair was sure to set the table in a roar; thus his
pleasure increased in proportion to the pleasure he gave; he loved all the world; and
he fancied all the world loved him. We were told that universal benevolence was
what first cemented society; we were taught to consider all the wants of mankind as
our own; to regard the human face divine with affection and esteem; he wound us
up to be mere machines of pity, and rendered us incapable of withstanding the
slightest impulse made either by real or fictitious distress; in a word, we were perfectly
instructed in the art of giving away thousands before we were taught the more
necessary qualifications of getting a farthing."</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_007.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>The Man in Black</i>—(<i>Citizen of the World.</i>)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>In fact, this inimitable Man in Black, who appears as one of the characters
in Goldsmith's "Citizen of the World," is, in many respects, a counterpart of
Goldsmith himself. Like our author, he is overreached by every knave, and an
object of contemptuous pity to all the worldly wise. He tries one position after
another, and fails in each, chiefly through his honesty and credulity. He cannot
<a id='Page_viii'></a>succeed as follower to a great man, because he will not flatter where he disapproves;
he loses his mistress because he believes her sincere when she expresses admiration of
him, and detestation of his rival's high-heeled shoes. Everywhere he is snubbed and
elbowed away by men more versed than himself in the ways of the world; but, like
Goldsmith again, he has an easy, good-humoured philosophy, that carries him gaily
through trials and troubles that would have swamped other men. As he cannot
be rich and happy, he resolves to be poor and contented. He does not "invoke
gods and men to see him dining upon a ha'porth of radishes;" but rather tries to
persuade himself and others that a vegetable diet suits him. And he has his reward
in the verdict universally pronounced upon him—that he "is very good-natured, and
has not the least harm in him."</p>

<p class='c009'>On a lad of ordinary disposition, the Rev. Charles Goldsmith's peculiar ideas
would, perhaps, have had little effect. The small world of the school-room, and the
larger world in which he would afterwards have to play his part, could scarcely fail to
teach him to distinguish between real and fictitious distress, and to give him
the prudence which makes charity begin at home, and, indeed, too often causes it to
end there. But the Goldsmiths were not ordinary people. Warm-hearted, and
of large sympathy—anxious to relieve the distress of all who sued to them for aid—they
were the very persons whom the prudent and prosperous are ever holding up
to ridicule, as dupes and simpletons, utterly deficient in wisdom—as though there
existed no other than <i>worldly</i> wisdom; as though "our being's end and aim"
were the attainment of wealth. And here, at the very outset, we come upon the
cause of many of the troubles and cares that beset Oliver Goldsmith throughout
his entire career. His kindly nature led him to relieve distress wherever he found it;
and, as his disposition became known, there is no doubt that distress—real and
feigned—sought him out pertinaciously enough.</p>

<p class='c009'>The words he wrote of his brother Henry, the benevolent clergyman—"passing
rich on forty pounds a year"—and whose "pride" was to "relieve the wretched,"
might be equally applied to himself. When applicants for succour came to him—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Careless their merits, or their faults to scan,</div>
      <div class='line'>His pity gave ere charity began."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But the wish to relieve was so largely in excess of the power, that frequently
when Justice called to present a claim for payment Generosity had been beforehand,
and had carried away the money; and Justice had to wait, or, alas, in too
many cases, to go away unsatisfied. Thus the most humiliating position in which
Goldsmith was ever placed in the days of his direst poverty, arose from his hastily
obeying an impulse to relieve the landlord of his miserable lodgings, who had
been arrested for debt, and whose wife came to Goldsmith, weeping and wringing her
hands. Thinking only how he could liberate the poor man by the only means
in his power, the poet rushed off and pledged some books, and a suit of clothes,
procured on the credit of Ralph Griffiths, a bookseller, that Goldsmith might appear
decently at an examination, which he failed to pass, and dire was the wrath of Griffiths
on the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young days of Oliver Goldsmith offer nothing very remarkable to record.
He was considered a dull boy by his first instructors, though there are indications
at times of poetical talent. One of his sisters married a gentleman of fortune of
the name of Hodson, to whom Henry Goldsmith, Oliver's eldest brother, was tutor.
In order that his daughter might not enter this family without a suitable marriage
portion, the Rev. Charles Goldsmith made a sacrifice, which, while it impoverished
the whole family, was peculiarly detrimental to the fortunes of Oliver. He executed
a bond, pledging himself to pay four hundred pounds as the marriage portion of
his daughter Catherine. The immediate effect of this proceeding was that Oliver
<a id='Page_ix'></a>was obliged to enter, in the humblest possible manner, upon the college career he
was about to commence. On the 11th of June, 1745, Oliver Goldsmith was
admitted as a sizar of Trinity College, Dublin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very wretched and very unsatisfactory was his life at that seat of learning.
The menial duties exacted in return for the reduced expense of the sizar's education
disgusted him. The brutalities of his tutor Wilder, a man at once ferocious and
pedantic, and totally unable to appreciate the young scholar's genius, caused him
the keenest mortification; and to these ills were added the grinding poverty with
which he now first became familiar; a poverty occasionally alleviated by gifts from
his uncle, the Rev. Mr. Contarine, a truly kind-hearted and benevolent man, to
whom our poet was bound to the last by ties of affectionate gratitude. Now also his
father died, and his necessities became greater than ever. We hear of him, writing
ballads, and selling the copyrights at five shillings each; then stealing out at night to
hear these, the earliest efforts of his muse, sung through the streets.</p>

<p class='c009'>A small triumph, in the shape of an exhibition, worth some thirty shillings,
induced the young awkward student to give a very humble kind of ball at his rooms.
To this ball came an unexpected visitor in the shape of Wilder the tutor, who put the
guests to flight, and publicly beat the host. Smarting under the disgrace, Goldsmith
quitted the college, and was only induced, after a time, to return by the persuasions of
his brother Henry, who brought about a reconciliation, or rather a truce, between
Oliver and his tyrant. On the 27th of February, 1749, he obtained his B.A. degree,
and, returning home, remained for a time idle and unemployed, looking out for the
chance of a career. He presented himself for ordination and was refused; was a tutor
in a private family, and left in consequence of a quarrel; was furnished with funds by
Uncle Contarine to study law, lost his money, and appeared again at home destitute.
At length, with some last assistance from the friendly uncle's purse, he started on a
tour through Europe; travelling, not like the majority of British tourists in coach
and on horseback, but on foot and alone, making his way from place to place, and
studying men rather than science. Important, and rich in results for his whole future
life, was this remarkable journey. And, among the most memorable of its effects was,
that it suggested the poem of the "Traveller." Marvellously true were the views
taken by the poor student of the various lands through which he passed; and
remarkable were the words in which, in one of his early essays, he predicted the
change that was coming upon France. Clearly and distinctly he heard the first far-off
mutterings of the great revolutionary storm. He saw the growth and spread of
the spirit of freedom among the people, and while others cried "peace" when there
was no peace, he distinctly and clearly foresaw the great crash of revolution that
was coming.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early in the year 1756 Oliver Goldsmith found himself alone in London. He
was in his twenty-eighth year—without a profession, almost utterly friendless, and
destitute of all means of subsistence. Of this part of his life he could be scarcely ever
induced to speak in his later and happier days; but here and there we get a
glimpse which shows us that it must have been dreary in the extreme. At Sir Joshua
Reynolds's he once startled the company by commencing an anecdote with "When
I lived among the beggars in Axe Lane;" and there is something very significant in
the way in which the pangs of starvation are described in his "Natural History."
He must have felt those pangs himself to describe them so graphically.</p>

<p class='c009'>By various means he made a shift to live. At one time he pounded drugs for an
apothecary near London Bridge; at another, he attempted to practise physic amongst
the poorest of the poor. Now we find him correcting press proofs for a printer; and
now he is settled for a time as usher in Dr. Milner's boys' school at Peckham. We
have a picture of him here, drawn by Miss Milner, the principal's daughter. He is
described as exceedingly good-natured, always ready to amuse the boys with his flute,
<a id='Page_x'></a>giving away his money, or spending it in tarts and sweetmeats for the boys as soon as
he received it, and generally recommending himself by his amiability and kindliness
of heart. But Goldsmith himself considered this servitude at the Peckham Academy
as the most dreary period of his life. The position of an usher was at that time, if
possible, worse than it is now; and the mortifications he experienced at Peckham
helped to throw a shadow over his later life.</p>

<p class='c009'>But on a certain day in April, 1757, Ralph Griffiths, a prosperous London bookseller,
dined at Peckham, with the Milners. He was the proprietor of a critical magazine;
and, as the conversation turned on the literature of the day, Griffiths became
aware that the remarks made by the poor usher were not those of an ordinary man.
He took him aside, and asked if he would undertake to write some literary notices and
reviews. The offer was accepted, as was also the very moderate salary Griffiths offered
in return for the daily services of the writer; and thus at last Goldsmith was fairly
started in authorship, and beginning to serve his apprenticeship to letters.</p>

<p class='c009'>A dreary apprenticeship it was. Griffiths, and Griffiths' wife, ruled over their
"hack" author with a rod of iron; curtailed his leisure, carped at the amount of
"work" done, and ruthlessly altered his articles. He began with some reviews, which,
for their elegance of style, facility of expression, and gracefulness of fancy, must have
astonished the readers of the ordinarily dull and common-place "Monthly Review."
Soon, however, the tyranny of the Griffiths pair became intolerable; a quarrel
ensued, and the connexion between master and servant was broken off. Goldsmith
established himself in a garret in a court near Fleet Street, and began the almost
hopeless attempt to support himself independently by miscellaneous writing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very hard and bitter was the struggle through which he had to pass; and now and
then he made efforts to emancipate himself entirely from the thraldom of literature.
Indeed, we even find him once more at his desk at Dr. Milner's school, at Peckham.
He obtained an appointment as medical officer in the East India Company's service on
the Coromandel coast, but lost it, probably through inability to pay his passage and
procure the necessary outfit. Then, as a last resource, he presented himself for examination
at Surgeons' Hall, intending to become a "hospital mate;" but was rejected,
as the books of the society record, as "not qualified." Thus, perforce driven back to
literature, he girded himself up manfully for the struggle; and gradually the dawn of a
better day began to break. The long and hard battle he had fought had at length
produced one gain for him. He was known to the bookselling fraternity; and, as they
would have phrased it, "his value in the market began to rise." A number of new
magazines were started simultaneously, and the proprietors were naturally anxious to
secure the services of Goldsmith's graceful pen. We find him writing for several
magazines at once, and receiving a respectable price for his work. Thus, with the year
1759, the shadow of squalid poverty and grinding want passes away from Goldsmith's
life. Happy would it have been for him had his distresses taught him prudence.
But the prosperity came too late. His habits were formed; the unfortunate custom of
living from hand to mouth, of flying from the thoughts of the dark future by heedless
indulgence in any pleasure that could be snatched in the present—the inveterate
disposition to alternate periods of over-work with intervals of thorough inaction—these
were the marks which the hard conflict had left upon him—wounds which were
seared over, indeed, but never thoroughly healed.</p>

<p><i>Goldsmith wandering among the streets<br />of the great, cold, wicked city.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>But these years of adversity had also taught him lessons whose memory remained with
him to the last day of his life—lessons which he was among the first to teach to the
unthinking world around him. Poverty and pain had spoilt him to some extent for
society—had brought upon him a melancholy which he would strive vainly to banish with
fits of strained and forced hilarity—had rendered him abrupt in speech and uncouth in
gesture—but never hardened his heart. He had been poor himself—miserably poor—and
his sympathies were with the poor, and his voice was honestly uplifted in their behalf.
Long before Sir Samuel Romilly had arisen to denounce the harshness and cruelty of our
penal code—long before the eagle glance of Howard had pierced into the gloom of the
debtor's fetid prison, Goldsmith pointed out the effects of harsh legislation, and the
evils and contamination of our gaols.He would leave his home at night to wander
<a id='Page_xii'></a>among the streets of the great, cold, wicked city, taking note of the misery and
destitution he found there, and sympathising with the distress of the wretched
outcasts whom none else would succour or befriend. And manfully was his voice
raised against those who, having caused much of that wretchedness, were suffered,
by a false and heartless system of mock morality, to escape the penalty of infamy
they had justly incurred.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a publication called the "Bee," which he edited, there is a paper of
matchless pathos, entitled a "City Nightpiece," in which he indignantly draws
attention to poor houseless girls, who have been flattered and cozened into sin,
and then left desolate in their misery. He concludes with the following withering
denunciation of the authors of all this misery:—</p>

<p class='c009'>"But let me turn from a scene of such distress to the sanctified hypocrite, who
has been 'talking of virtue till the time of bed',<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and now steals out, to give a loose
to his vices under the protection of midnight—vices more atrocious because he
attempts to conceal them. See how he pants down the dark alley; and, with
hastening steps, fears an acquaintance in every face. He has passed the whole day
in company he hates, and now goes to prolong the night among company that as
heartily hate him. May his vices be detected! may the morning rise upon his
shame! Yet I wish to no purpose: villany, when detected, never gives up, but
boldly adds impudence to imposture."</p>

<p class='c009'>Goldsmith's Essays, afterwards collected by himself into a volume, were chiefly
written between 1758 and 1762. In this kind of writing he peculiarly excelled; and
his friend Dr. Johnson allowed him to be unrivalled in it. As a specimen of his
humourous style, the following extract from the "History of a Strolling Player"
may be taken as displaying the quaint drollery and quiet fun he could infuse in this
style of composition. Goldsmith has picked up in one of the parks a jocose, talkative,
hungry man, who proposes that the two should dine at the expense of his new
acquaintance, promising that he himself will return the favour at some future time
not accurately defined. Stimulated by a good dinner, and by a tankard which he
takes care shall be frequently replenished, the talkative man tells his history, of
which the following is a part. He has been a soldier, and finds the profession not at
all to his liking. He says:</p>

<p class='c009'>"The life of a soldier soon, therefore, gave me the spleen. I asked leave to quit
the service; but, as I was tall and strong, my captain thanked me for my kind intention,
and said, because he had a regard for me, we should not part. I wrote to my
father a very dismal penitent letter, and desired that he would raise money to pay for
my discharge; but, as the good old man was as fond of drinking as I was, (sir, my
service to you), and those who are fond of drinking never pay for other people's
discharges; in short, he never answered my letter. What could be done? If I
have not money, said I to myself, to pay for my discharge, I must find an equivalent
some other way; and that must be by running away. I deserted; and that answered
my purpose every bit as well as if I had bought my discharge.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Parnell.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>"Well, I was now fairly rid of my military employment. I sold my soldier's
clothes, bought worse, and, in order not to be overtaken, took the most unfrequented
roads possible. One evening, as I was entering a village, I perceived a man, whom I
afterwards found to be the curate of the parish, thrown from his horse in a miry
road, and almost smothered in the mud. He desired my assistance: I gave it, and
drew him out with some difficulty. He thanked me for my trouble, and was going
off; but I followed him home, for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own
door. The curate asked a hundred questions; as whose son I was, from whence I
came, and whether I would be faithful. I answered him greatly to his satisfaction,
<a id='Page_xiii'></a>and gave myself one of the best characters in the world for sobriety (sir, I have the
honour of drinking your health), discretion, and fidelity. To make a long story
short, he wanted a servant, and hired me. With him I lived but two months: we
did not much like each other. I was fond of eating, and he gave me but little to eat:
I loved a pretty girl, and the old woman, my fellow-servant, was ill-natured and ugly.
As they endeavoured to starve me between them, I made a pious resolution to prevent
their committing murder: I stole the eggs as soon as they were laid: I emptied every
unfinished bottle that I could lay my hands on: whatever eatable came in my way
was sure to disappear. In short, they found I would not do; so I was discharged one
morning, and paid three shillings and sixpence for two months' wages.</p>

<p><i>The Strolling Player.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>"While my money was getting ready, I employed myself in making preparations
for my departure. Two hens were hatching in an outhouse—I went and took the
eggs from habit; and not to separate the parents from the children, I lodged hens
and all in my knapsack. After this piece of frugality, I returned to receive my
money, and with my knapsack on my back, and a staff in my hand, I bade adieu,
with tears in my eyes, to my old benefactor. I had not gone far from the house
when I heard behind me a cry of 'stop thief!' but this only increased my dispatch:
it would have been foolish to stop, as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me—but
hold, I think I passed those two months at the curate's without drinking. Come,
the times are dry, and may this be my poison, it ever I spent two more pious, stupid
months in all my life.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_xiv'></a>"Well, after travelling some days, whom should I light upon but a company of
strolling players. The moment I saw them at a distance, my heart warmed to them;
I had a sort of natural love for everything of the vagabond order. They were
employed in settling their baggage, which had been overturned in a narrow way: I
offered my assistance, which they accepted; and we soon became so well acquainted,
that they took me as a servant. This was a paradise to me; they sang, danced,
drank, ate, and travelled, all at the same time. By the blood of all the Mirabels! I
thought I had never lived till then; I grew as merry as a grig, and laughed at every
word that was spoken. They liked me as much as I liked them: I was a very good
figure, as you may see; and though I was poor, I was not modest.</p>

<p class='c009'>"I love a straggling life above all things in the world; sometimes good, sometimes
bad; to be warm to-day, and cold to-morrow; to eat when one can get it, and
drink when (the tankard is out) it stands before me. We arrived that evening at
Tenterden, and took a large room at the 'Greyhound,' where we resolved to exhibit
Romeo and Juliet, with the funeral procession, the grave, and the garden scene.
Romeo was to be performed by a gentleman from the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane;
Juliet, by a lady who had never appeared on any stage before; and I was to snuff the
candles: all excellent in our way. We had figures enough, but the difficulty was to
dress them."</p>

<p class='c009'>Equally humourous is the account of Mr. Jack Spindle, the "good-natured man,"
who has been pestered during his prosperity with offers of service, which he finds
suddenly and unaccountably withdrawn when the sun no longer shines upon him.
His friends have, one and all, been importunate with him, that he should use their
name and credit if ever the time should come when he needed them; and now that
this time had most certainly arrived, Jack proceeded with the most perfect good faith
to put some of these assertions to the proof. To quote our author:—</p>

<p class='c009'>"Jack, therefore, thought he might use his old friend without any ceremony; and,
as a man confident of not being refused, requested the use of a hundred guineas for a
few days, as he just then had an occasion for money. 'And pray, Mr. Spindle,'
replied the scrivener, 'do you want all this money?'—'Want it, sir,' says the
other, 'if I did not want it I should not have asked it.'—'I am sorry for that,'
says the friend; 'for those who want money when they come to borrow, will want
when they should come to pay. To say the truth, Mr. Spindle, money is money now-a-days.
I believe it is all sunk in the bottom of the sea, for my part; and he that has
got a little is a fool if he does not keep what he has got.'</p>

<p class='c009'>"Not quite disconcerted by this refusal, our adventurer was resolved to apply to
another, whom he knew to be the very best friend he had in the world. The gentleman
whom he now addressed received his proposal with all the affability that could be
expected from generous friendship. 'Let me see,—you want a hundred guineas;
and, pray, dear Jack, would not fifty answer?'—'If you have but fifty to spare, sir,
I must be contented.'—'Fifty to spare! I do not say that, for I believe I have but
twenty about me.'—'Then I must borrow the other thirty from some other friend.'—'And
pray,' replied the friend, 'would it not be the best way to borrow the whole
money from that other friend, and then one note will serve for all, you know? Lord,
Mr. Spindle, make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I'm your friend,
when you choose a bit of dinner, or so. You, Tom, see the gentleman down. You
won't forget to dine with us now and then? Your very humble servant.'</p>

<p class='c009'>"Distressed, but not discouraged at this treatment, he was at last resolved to find
that assistance from love, which he could not have from friendship. Miss Jenny
Dismal had a fortune in her own hands, and she had already made all the advances
that her sex's modesty would permit. He made his proposal, therefore, with confidence,
but soon perceived, 'No bankrupt ever found the fair one kind.' Miss Jenny
<a id='Page_xv'></a>and Master Billy Galoon were lately fallen deeply in love with each other, and the
whole neighbourhood thought it would soon be a match.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Every day now began to strip Jack of his former finery: his clothes flew piece by
piece to the pawnbrokers'; and he seemed at length equipped in the genuine mourning
of antiquity. But still he thought himself secure from starving; the numberless
invitations he had received to dine, even after his losses, were yet unanswered; he
was, therefore, now resolved to accept of a dinner, because he wanted one; and in this
manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week without being openly
affronted."</p>

<p class='c009'>In the "Citizen of the World" are to be found some of the best essays of Goldsmith.
It was a happy idea that of pourtraying our national peculiarities and customs
in the light in which they might strike a foreigner; and the series contain, moreover,
besides the inimitable "Man in Black," a portrait which would in itself be enough to
make it immortal—the fussy, pleasant, consequential, little Beau Tibbs. Was there
ever such a perseveringly happy man? He speaks of his own miserable poverty as if it
were wealth, affects to prefer a bit of ox cheek and some "brisk beer" to ortolans and
claret, and gives himself the airs of a lord while Mrs. Tibbs is laboriously seeing his
second shirt through the washing tub. After all, there may be more true philosophy
in the cheerfulness of little Tibbs than in the querulous grumbling of greater men on
<a id='Page_xvi'></a>whom the keen wind of adversity blows and who shout vociferous complaints as they
shiver in the keen blast. Beau Tibbs' hilarious cheerfulness is, after all, but an
exaggerated phase of the equanimity of the "Man in Black."</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Jack Spindle rejected by Miss Jenny Dismal.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>It was a day in the poet's life to be marked with a white stone when he made the
acquaintance of Johnson. The "great cham of literature," as Smollett called him,
understood and appreciated Goldsmith better than did the shallow witlings who laughed
at the poet's eccentricities and awkwardness, but had not the sense to discover his
genius. And who, better than Goldsmith, could value and respect the great qualities
that lay hidden under Johnson's brusque manners and overbearing roughness? Their
acquaintance soon ripened into friendship—a friendship that was a joy and solace to
Goldsmith until the day of his death. Just at this time Johnson, after many years'
hard and unproductive toil had been rewarded with a well-earned pension. Thus lifted
above the struggling crowd of his literary brethren, he filled a sort of dictatorial
throne among them. In Goldsmith he took quite a peculiar interest, and quickly
became what Washington Irving, in his "Life of Goldsmith," happily designates a
kind of "growling supervisor of the poet's affairs."</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a supervision was but too urgently needed. Increased means had not improved
the poet's habits, or taught him self-denial. The pay for his literary labour
was almost invariably drawn and spent before the task was completed, and already poor
Goldsmith was becoming involved in that net of embarrassment from which he never
extricated himself; and thus the following scene was one day enacted, which shall be
<a id='Page_xvii'></a>told in Johnson's own words, as reported by the indefatigable Boswell:—"I received
one morning," said Johnson, "a message from poor Goldsmith that he was in great
distress, and as it was not in his power to come to me, begged that I would come to
him as soon as possible. I sent him a guinea, and promised to come to him directly.
I accordingly went as soon as I was dressed, and found that his landlady had arrested
him for his rent, at which he was in a violent passion. I perceived that he had already
changed my guinea, and had got a bottle of madeira and a glass before him. I put the
cork into the bottle, desired he would be calm, and began to talk to him of the means
by which he might be extricated. He then told me that he had a novel ready for the
press, which he produced to me. I looked into it, and saw its merit; told the landlady
I should soon return; and having gone to a bookseller, sold it for sixty pounds.
I brought Goldsmith the money, and he discharged his rent, not without rating his
landlady in a high tone for having used him so ill."</p>

<p class='c009'>The book thus sold for sixty pounds was the "Vicar of Wakefield," a work never
surpassed for wonderful vitality of character and for beauty of colouring. The old
vicar, loveable in his very weakness, and indulgent as a Christian priest should be
towards the weaknesses of others—the downright honest buxom wife, whose maternal
vanity at times tempts her so sorely to disobedience against the behests of her lord
and master—Olivia the coquette, and Sophia the prude—Moses the honest and
simple—and Burchell with his grand monosyllabic commentary of "Fudge,"—these
will live so long as English Literature lasts, and be remembered with delight when
the pretentious effusions of the Richardson school have vanished into the limbo of
obscurity. But the outcry that has since been raised against the bookseller who
only gave sixty pounds for the manuscript appears somewhat unjust. Francis Newbery
gave the sum demanded by Johnson, evidently without reading the book, and on
Johnson's recommendation alone. That he had no great hopes of profit from his
bargain is proved by the length of time he allowed it to lie unpublished in his desk.
It was not Newbery's fault that the manuscript was sent out at a pinch, to be sold
for what it would bring, before it had even been read to a few discerning friends who
might have given a deliberate opinion on its merits. Johnson spoke sensibly enough
when he replied to the indignant protest,—" A sufficient price, too, when it was sold;
for then the fame of Goldsmith had not been elevated, as it afterwards was, by his
'Traveller;' and the bookseller had faint hopes of profit by his bargain. After the
'Traveller,' to be sure, it was accidentally worth more money."</p>

<p class='c009'>The "Traveller" was now completed, and was published very shortly after the
bailiff episode. It took the circle who surrounded Goldsmith completely by surprise;
some of the members of the Literary Club even affected to doubt that he could have
written it, and declared that the most striking passages were the work of Johnson.
But Johnson himself laughed at all this, and openly and honestly proclaimed his
belief in the great merits of the poem, and declared that since the death of Pope
nothing equal to it had been written. The touches which describe the various shades
of character in the different nations are exquisite, and can only be the result of personal
observation aided by mature thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now our poet resolved to try his powers in a new field—to write a comedy,
the remuneration for which should pay off the debts that were fast accumulating
round him. But here fresh vexation and new care awaited him. Garrick, the great
actor and prosperous manager, to whom he offered the play, took upon himself the
office of critic and emendator, authoritatively suggested the entire omission of <i>Lofty</i>,
one of the best characters, and, to use an expressive vulgarism, seemed inclined to
"burke" the comedy altogether. Goldsmith, smarting under the actor's patronizing
criticism, became angry, refused to alter or amend the play, and finally took the
manuscript out of Garrick's hands, and transferred it to the rival management of
Colman at Covent Garden. But Colman, though he accepted the piece, had little or
<a id='Page_xviii'></a>no hope that it would be a success; and he contrived to impart his own doubts and
misgivings to the whole company. The fact was, that, at this period, sentimental
comedy, showing men and women as they appear in the pages of novelists of a
certain school, but not as they walk and talk in real life, was in the ascendant;
and Hugh Kelly—a man with some ingenuity, but without a spark of genius—was
the great representative of this school of writing. Now Goldsmith held that a
comedy should be comic—that it should, above all things, amuse the spectators by
humourous dialogue and startling action; and, in his dramatic creed, the enunciation
of moral platitudes had no place. In fact, the lines Goldsmith afterwards wrote
concerning Cumberland, Kelly's successor in the Sentimental School of Comedy,
might well have been applied to Kelly himself:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_xix'></a>Now this Hugh Kelly had just produced a stupid comedy, insipid and full of
mawkish sentimentality, and entitled "False Delicacy." It was acted at Drury
Lane, while Goldsmith's "Good-Natured Man" was in rehearsal, and proved a
complete success. This triumph of Kelly's further damaged the hopes of Colman
and his actors. Goldsmith had made his hero, not an impossible monster of virtue,
but an easy-going, kindly gentleman, who shows that excessive good-nature is, after
all, only a kind of weakness. The fun was broad and hearty, and the characters
were drawn in a style that differed from Kelly's as widely as a picture by Hogarth
would differ from a pastoral piece by Watteau. At last the comedy was performed;
and though it brought nearly five hundred pounds to the distressed poet, it was at
first not successful. The taste of the town had been too much spoiled by the
sentimentalisms of Kelly and his school, to appreciate at once the strong, hearty
fare now offered; and especially was public opinion divided on the subject of
the introduction of two bailiffs, who were then considered "low," and whose
appearance is now acknowledged to be one of the best "points" in the whole play.
Goldsmith declared he would write for the theatre no more: but fortunately he did
not keep to his determination. Once again, in 1772, he wrote a comedy—one
of the very best of our English plays—"She Stoops to Conquer," which was performed
at Covent Garden, for the first time, on the 15th of March, 1773. Again was
Goldsmith harassed by the misgivings of Colman, though sentimental comedy was
no longer in the ascendant. It had never recovered the blow inflicted by a burlesque
of Foote's, entitled "The Virtuous Housemaid; or Piety in Pattens," in which the
mawkish platitudes of the sentimental school were turned into pitiless ridicule. But
the laughter and cheers of a crowded house completely took Colman and the croakers
by surprise; and so utter was their astonishment, that the town made sport of the
doubters whose prognostications had proved so false. Colman was obliged to run
away to Bath, from the shower of lampoons that hailed down upon him. One of the
best of these bade him take comfort from the idea that though Goldsmith's present
play succeeded, his next might fail; and advised Colman to bring about that desirable
consummation, if all other methods failed, by writing the best play he could himself,
and printing it in Goldsmith's name. "She Stoops to Conquer" has kept the stage
for nearly a century, and bids fair long to retain its place. It was a triumph for our
poet, but it was his last.</p>

<p class='c009'>For now money troubles and embarrassments thickened more and more around
him. His fame, indeed, was established; but his habits of procrastination and unthrift
were but too well known. The "Deserted Village" had silenced those even who
carped at the "Traveller;" his charming "Animated Nature" had brought him profit
and reputation as a scientific writer; but his dilatoriness and want of method spoiled all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early in 1774 he was attacked by an illness to which he was subject, and as a remedy
for which he obstinately insisted on dosing himself with "James's Powders." He grew
rapidly worse, and to the question asked by his medical man: "Is your mind at ease?"
replied with a mournful "No, it is not." For some days he fluctuated between life
and death; but at last, on the morning of the 4th of April, strong convulsions came
on, under which he expired.</p>

<p class='c009'>His death was mourned by a circle of friends comprising some of the most illustrious
names in the land. A public funeral was proposed for him, but negatived in
consideration of his embarrassed circumstances. For, alas! in spite of the success of
his later years, he owed nearly two thousand pounds. "Was ever poet so trusted
before!" exclaimed sturdy old Johnson. "But," added the same honest friend,
pronouncing a verdict which a century has since endorsed, "let not his failings be
remembered—he was a very great man!"</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER I.</i><br /> <br /><i>The description of the family of Wakefield,<br />in which a kindred likeness prevails<br />as well of minds as of persons.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>I was ever of opinion that the honest man, who married and brought up a
large family, did more service than he who continued single, and only talked
of population. From this motive, I had scarcely taken orders a year, before I
began to think seriously of matrimony, and chose my wife, as she did her
wedding gown, not for a fine glossy surface, but such qualities as would wear
well. To do her justice, she was a good-natured, notable woman; and as for
breeding, there were few country ladies who could show more. She could
read any English book without much spelling; but for pickling, preserving,
and cookery, none could excel her. She prided herself also upon being an
excellent contriver in housekeeping, though I could never find that we grew
richer with all her contrivances.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, we loved each other tenderly, and our fondness increased as we
grew old. There was, in fact, nothing that could make us angry with the
world or each other. We had an elegant house, situated in a fine country and
a good neighbourhood. The year was spent in moral or rural amusement;
in visiting our rich neighbours, and relieving such as were poor. We had no
revolutions to fear, nor fatigues to undergo; all our adventures were by the
fireside, and all our migrations from the blue bed to the brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>As we lived near the road, we often had the traveller or stranger visit us to
taste our gooseberry-wine, for which we had great reputation; and I profess,
with the veracity of an historian, that I never knew one of them find fault
with it. Our cousins too, even to the fortieth remove, all remembered their
affinity, without any help from the heralds' office, and came very frequently to
see us. Some of them did us no great honour by these claims of kindred; as
we had the blind, the maimed, and the halt amongst the number. However,
my wife always insisted that, as they were the same <i>flesh and blood</i>, they should
sit with us at the same table: so that if we had not very rich, we generally
had very happy friends about us; for this remark will hold good through life,
that the poorer the guest the better pleased he ever is with being treated; and
as some men gaze with admiration at the colours of a tulip, or the wing of a
butterfly, so I was by nature an admirer of happy human faces. However,
when any one of our relations was found to be a person of a very bad
character, a troublesome guest, or one we desired to get rid of, upon his
leaving my house I ever took care to lend him a riding-coat, or a pair of boots,
or sometimes a horse of small value, and I always had the satisfaction of
finding he never came back to return them. By this the house was cleared of
such as we did not like; but never was the family of Wakefield known to turn
the traveller or the poor dependent out of doors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus we lived several years in a state of much happiness; not but that we
sometimes had those little rubs which Providence sends to enhance the value
<a id='Page_3'></a>of its favours. My orchard was often robbed by school-boys, and my wife's
custards plundered by the cats or the children. The squire would sometimes
fall asleep in the most pathetic parts of my sermon, or his lady return my
wife's civilities at church with a mutilated curtsey. But we soon got over the
uneasiness caused by such accidents, and usually in three or four days began
to wonder how they vexed us.</p>

<p class='c009'>My children, the offspring of temperance, as they were educated without
softness, so they were at once well-formed and healthy; my sons hardy and
active, my daughters beautiful and blooming. When I stood in the midst of
the little circle, which promised to be the support of my declining age, I
could not avoid repeating the famous story of Count Abensberg, who, in
Henry the Second's progress through Germany, while other courtiers came
with their treasures, brought his thirty-two children, and presented them to
his sovereign as the most valuable offering he had to bestow. In this manner,
though I had but six, I considered them as a very valuable present made to
my country, and consequently looked upon it as my debtor. Our eldest son
was named George, after his uncle, who left us ten thousand pounds. Our
second child, a girl, I intended to call after her aunt Grissel; but my wife,
who during her pregnancy had been reading romances, insisted upon her
being called Olivia. In less than another year we had another daughter, and
now I was determined that Grissel should be her name; but a rich relation
taking a fancy to stand godmother, the girl was by her directions called
Sophia; so that we had two romantic names in the family; but I solemnly
protest I had no hand in it. Moses was our next, and after an interval of
twelve years we had two sons more.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be fruitless to deny my exultation when I saw my little ones about
me; but the vanity and the satisfaction of my wife were even greater than
mine. When our visitors would say, "Well, upon my word, Mrs. Primrose,
you have the finest children in the whole country;"—"Ay, neighbour," she
would answer, "they are as heaven made them—handsome enough, if they
be good enough; for handsome is that handsome does." And then she
would bid the girls hold up their heads; who, to conceal nothing, were
certainly very handsome. Mere outside is so very trifling a circumstance with
me, that I should scarcely have remembered to mention it, had it not been a
general topic of conversation in the country. Olivia, now about eighteen,
had that luxuriancy of beauty with which painters generally draw Hebe:
open, sprightly, and commanding. Sophia's features were not so striking at
<a id='Page_4'></a>first, but often did more certain execution; for they were soft, modest, and
alluring. The one vanquished by a single blow, the other by efforts successively
repeated.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/i_023.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Olivia and Sophia.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The temper of a woman is generally formed from the turn of her features;
at least it was so with my daughters. Olivia wished for many lovers; Sophia
to secure one. Olivia was often affected, from too great a desire to please;
Sophia even repressed excellence, from her fear to offend. The one entertained
me with her vivacity when I was gay, the other with her sense when I
was serious. But these qualities were never carried to excess in either, and
<a id='Page_5'></a>I have often seen them exchange characters for a whole day together. A
suit of mourning has transformed my coquette into a prude, and a new set
of ribands has given her younger sister more than natural vivacity. My eldest
<a id='Page_6'></a>son, George, was bred at Oxford, as I intended him for one of the learned
professions. My second boy, Moses, whom I designed for business, received a
sort of miscellaneous education at home. But it is needless to attempt
describing the particular characters of young people that had seen but very
little of the world. In short, a family likeness prevailed through all; and,
properly speaking, they had but one character—that of being all equally
generous, credulous, simple, and inoffensive.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER II.</i><br /> <br /><i>Family misfortunes.</i>—<i>The loss of fortune only serves<br />to increase the pride of the worthy.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The temporal concerns of our family were chiefly committed to my wife's
management; as to the spiritual, I took them entirely under my own direction.
The profits of my living, which amounted to about thirty-five pounds a year,
I made over to the orphans and widows of the clergy of our diocese; for,
having a sufficient fortune of my own, I was careless of temporalities, and felt
a secret pleasure in doing my duty without reward. I also set a resolution of
keeping no curate, and of being acquainted with every man in the parish,
exhorting the married men to temperance, and the bachelors to matrimony;
so that in a few years it was a common saying, that there were three
strange wants at Wakefield—a parson wanting pride, young men wanting
wives, and alehouses wanting customers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Matrimony was always one of my favourite topics, and I wrote several
sermons to prove its happiness; but there was a peculiar tenet which I made
a point of supporting: for I maintained, with Whiston, that it was unlawful
for a priest of the Church of England, after the death of his first wife, to take
a second: or, to express it in one word, I valued myself upon being a strict
monogamist.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was early initiated into this important dispute, on which so many
laborious volumes have been written. I published some tracts upon the
subject myself, which, as they never sold, I have the consolation of thinking
were read only by the happy <i>few</i>. Some of my friends called this my weak
side; but, alas! they had not, like me, made it the subject of long contemplation.
The more I reflected upon it, the more important it appeared. I
<a id='Page_7'></a>even went a step beyond Whiston in displaying my principles: as he had
engraven upon his wife's tomb that she was the <i>only</i> wife of William Whiston;
so I wrote a similar epitaph for my wife, though still living, in which I
extolled her prudence, economy, and obedience till death; and, having got it
copied fair, with an elegant frame, it was placed over the chimney-piece,
where it answered several very useful purposes. It admonished my wife of
her duty to me and my fidelity to her; it inspired her with a passion for
fame, and constantly put her in mind of her end.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was thus, perhaps, from hearing marriage so often recommended, that
my eldest son, just upon leaving college, fixed his affections upon the daughter
of a neighbouring clergyman, who was a dignitary in the church, and in
circumstances to give her a large fortune; but fortune was her smallest accomplishment.
Miss Arabella Wilmot was allowed by all (except my two
daughters) to be completely pretty. Her youth, health, and innocence were
still heightened by a complexion so transparent, and such a happy sensibility
of look, as even age could not gaze on with indifference. As Mr. Wilmot
knew that I could make a very handsome settlement on my son, he was not
averse to the match; so both families lived together in all that harmony which
generally precedes an expected alliance. Being convinced, by experience, that
the days of courtship are the most happy of our lives, I was willing enough to
lengthen the period; and the various amusements which the young couple
every day shared in each other's company seemed to increase their passion.
We were generally awakened in the morning by music, and on fine days rode
a-hunting. The hours between breakfast and dinner the ladies devoted to
dress and study: they usually read a page, and then gazed at themselves in
the glass, which even philosophers might own often presented the page of
greatest beauty. At dinner my wife took the lead; for, as she always insisted
upon carving everything herself, it being her mother's way, she gave us, upon
these occasions, the history of every dish. When we had dined, to prevent
the ladies leaving us I generally ordered the table to be removed; and sometimes,
with the music-master's assistance, the girls would give us a very
agreeable concert. Walking out, drinking tea, country-dances, and forfeits
shortened the rest of the day, without the assistance of cards, as I hated all
manner of gaming, except backgammon, at which my old friend and I sometimes
took a twopenny hit. Nor can I here pass over an ominous circumstance
that happened the last time we played together: I only wanted to fling
a quatre, and yet I threw deuce-ace five times running.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_8'></a>Some months were elapsed in this manner, till at last it was thought
convenient to fix a day for the nuptials of the young couple, who seemed
earnestly to desire it. During the preparations for the wedding, I need not
describe the busy importance of my wife, nor the sly looks of my daughters:
in fact my attention was fixed on another object—the completing a tract which
I intended shortly to publish in defence of my favourite principle. As I
looked upon this as a masterpiece, both for argument and style, I could not
in the pride of my heart avoid showing it to my old friend Mr. Wilmot, as I
made no doubt of receiving his approbation: but not till too late I discovered
that he was violently attached to the contrary opinion, and with good reason;
for he was at that time actually courting a fourth wife. This, as may be
expected, produced a dispute attended with some acrimony, which threatened
to interrupt our intended alliance; but, on the day before that appointed for
the ceremony, we agreed to discuss the subject at large.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was managed with proper spirit on both sides: he asserted that I was
heterodox; I retorted the charge; he replied, and I rejoined. In the meantime,
while the controversy was hottest, I was called out by one of my relations,
who, with a face of concern, advised me to give up the dispute, at least till my
son's wedding was over. "How!" cried I, "relinquish the cause of truth, and
let him be a husband, already driven to the very verge of absurdity? You
might as well advise me to give up my fortune as my argument." "Your
fortune," returned my friend, "I am now sorry to inform you, is almost nothing.
The merchant in town in whose hands your money was lodged, has gone off,
to avoid a statute of bankruptcy, and is thought not to have left a shilling in
the pound. I was unwilling to shock you or the family with the account till
after the wedding; but now it may serve to moderate your warmth in the
argument; for I suppose your own prudence will enforce the necessity of
dissembling, at least till your son has the young lady's fortune secure."
"Well," returned I, "if what you tell me be true, and if I am to be a
beggar, it shall never make me a rascal, or induce me to disavow my principles.
I'll go this moment and inform the company of my circumstances:
and as for the argument, I even here retract my former concessions in the
old gentleman's favour, nor will I allow him now to be a husband in any sense
of the expression."</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be useless to describe the different sensations of both families,
when I divulged the news of our misfortune; but what others felt was slight
to what the lovers appeared to endure. Mr. Wilmot, who seemed before
<a id='Page_9'></a>sufficiently inclined to break off the match, was by this blow soon determined:
one virtue he had in perfection, which was prudence—too often the only one
that is left us at seventy-two.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER III.</i><br /> <br /><i>A migration.—The fortunate circumstances of<br />our lives are generally found at<br />last to be of our own procuring.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The only hope of our family now was, that the report of our misfortune
might be malicious or premature: but a letter from my agent in town soon
came with a confirmation of every particular. The loss of fortune to myself
alone would have been trifling: the only uneasiness I felt was for my family,
who were to be humbled, without an education to render them callous to
contempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Near a fortnight had passed before I attempted to restrain their affliction;
for premature consolation is but the remembrancer of sorrow. During this
interval, my thoughts were employed on some future means of supporting
them; and at last a small cure of fifteen pounds a year was offered me in a
distant neighbourhood, where I could still enjoy my principles without molestation.
With this proposal I joyfully closed, having determined to increase my
salary by managing a little farm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having taken this resolution, my next care was to get together the wrecks
of my fortune; and, all debts collected and paid, out of fourteen thousand
pounds we had but four hundred remaining. My chief attention, therefore,
was now to bring down the pride of my family to their circumstances; for I
well knew that aspiring beggary is wretchedness itself. "You cannot be
ignorant, my children," cried I, "that no prudence of ours could have
prevented our late misfortune; but prudence may do much in disappointing
its effects. We are now poor, my fondlings, and wisdom bids us to conform
to our humble situation. Let us, then, without repining, give up those
splendours with which numbers are wretched, and seek, in humbler circumstances,
that peace with which all may be happy. The poor live pleasantly
without our help; why then should not we learn to live without theirs? No,
my children, let us from this moment give up all pretensions to gentility; we
have still enough left for happiness if we are wise, and let us draw upon
content for the deficiencies of fortune."</p>

<p class='c009'>As my eldest son was bred a scholar, I determined to send him to town,
where his abilities might contribute to our support and his own. The
<a id='Page_11'></a>separation of friends and families is, perhaps, one of the most distressful
circumstances attendant on penury. The day soon arrived on which we were
to disperse for the first time. My son, after taking leave of his mother and the
rest, who mingled their tears with their kisses, came to ask a blessing from me.
This I gave him from my heart, and which, added to five guineas, was all the
patrimony I had now to bestow. "You are going, my boy," cried I, "to
London on foot, in the manner Hooker, your great ancestor, travelled there
before you. Take from me the same horse that was given him by the good
Bishop Jewel, this staff; and take this book too—it will be your comfort on the
way; these two lines in it are worth a million—<i>I have been young, and now am
old; yet never saw I the righteous man forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread</i>.
Let this be your consolation as you travel on. Go, my boy; whatever be thy
fortune, let me see thee once a year; still keep a good heart, and farewell."
As he was possessed of integrity and honour, I was under no apprehensions
from throwing him naked into the amphitheatre of life; for I knew he would
act a good part, whether vanquished or victorious.</p>

<p class='c009'>His departure only prepared the way for our own, which arrived a few days
afterwards. The leaving a neighbourhood in which we had enjoyed so many
hours of tranquillity was not without a tear, which scarcely fortitude itself
could suppress. Besides, a journey of seventy miles, to a family that had
hitherto never been above ten from home, filled us with apprehension; and the
cries of the poor, who followed us for some miles, contributed to increase it.
The first day's journey brought us in safety within thirty miles of our future
retreat, and we put up for the night at an obscure inn in a village by the way.
When we were shown a room, I desired the landlord, in my usual way, to let
us have his company, with which he complied, as what he drank would increase
the bill next morning. He knew, however, the whole neighbourhood to which
I was removing, particularly Squire Thornhill, who was to be my landlord, and
who lived within a few miles of the place. This gentleman he described as
one who desired to know little more of the world than its pleasures, being
particularly remarkable for his attachment to the fair sex. He observed, that
no virtue was able to resist his arts and assiduity, and that there was scarcely
a farmer's daughter within ten miles round but what had found him successful
and faithless. Though this account gave me some pain, it had a very different
effect upon my daughters, whose features seemed to brighten with the expectation
of an approaching triumph; nor was my wife less pleased and confident
of their allurements and virtue. While our thoughts were thus employed, the
<a id='Page_12'></a>hostess entered the room to inform her husband that the strange gentleman,
who had been two days in the house, wanted money, and could not satisfy
them for his reckoning. "Want money!" replied the host, "that must be
impossible; for it was no later than yesterday he paid three guineas to our
beadle to spare an old broken soldier that was to be whipped through the town
for dog-stealing." The hostess, however, still persisting in her first assertion,
he was preparing to leave the room, swearing that he would be satisfied one
way or another, when I begged the landlord would introduce me to a stranger
of so much charity as he described. With this he complied, showing in
a gentleman who seemed to be about thirty, dressed in clothes that once
were laced. His person was well-formed, and his face marked with the lines
of thinking. He had something short and dry in his address, and seemed not
to understand ceremony, or to despise it. Upon the landlord's leaving the
room, I could not avoid expressing my concern to the stranger at seeing a
gentleman in such circumstances, and offered him my purse to satisfy the
present demand. "I take it with all my heart, sir," replied he, "and am glad
that a late oversight, in giving what money I had about me, has shown me that
there are still some men like you. I must, however, previously entreat being
informed of the name and residence of my benefactor, in order to repay him
as soon as possible." In this I satisfied him fully, not only mentioning my
name and late misfortune, but the place to which I was going to remove.
"This," cried he, "happens still more luckily than I hoped for, as I am going
the same way myself, having been detained here two days by the floods, which
I hope, by to-morrow, will be found passable." I testified the pleasure I
should have in his company, and my wife and daughters joining in entreaty,
he was prevailed upon to stay supper. The stranger's conversation, which was
at once pleasing and instructive, induced me to wish for a continuance of it;
but it was now high time to retire and take refreshment against the fatigues of
the following day.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>"<i>My wife and daughters joining in entreaty,<br />he was prevailed upon to stay supper.</i>"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The next morning we all set forward together: my family on horseback,
while Mr. Burchell, our new companion, walked along the foot-path by the
road-side, observing, with a smile, that as we were ill mounted he would be too
generous to attempt leaving us behind. As the floods were not yet subsided,
we were obliged to hire a guide, who trotted on before, Mr. Burchell and I
bringing up the rear. We lightened the fatigues of the road with philosophical
disputes, which he seemed to understand perfectly. But what surprised me
most was, that though he was a money-borrower, he defended his opinions
<a id='Page_13'></a>with as much obstinacy as if he had been my patron. He now and then also
informed me to whom the different seats belonged that lay in our view as we
travelled the road. "That," cried he, pointing to a very magnificent house
which stood at some distance, "belongs to Mr. Thornhill, a young gentleman
who enjoys a large fortune, though entirely dependent on the will of his uncle,
Sir William Thornhill, a gentleman who, content with a little himself, permits
his nephew to enjoy the rest, and chiefly resides in town."
"What!" cried I, "is my young landlord then the nephew of a man whose
virtues, generosity, and singularities are so universally known? I have
heard Sir William Thornhill represented as one of the most generous,
yet whimsical men in the kingdom; a man of consummate benevolence."
"Something, perhaps, too much so," replied Mr. Burchell; "at least, he
carried benevolence to an
excess when young, for his passions were then strong, and as they were all
upon the side of virtue, they led it up to a romantic extreme. He early began
to aim at the qualifications of the soldier and the scholar; was soon distinguished
<a id='Page_14'></a>in the army, and had some reputation among men of learning.
Adulation ever follows the ambitious; for such alone receive most pleasure
from flattery. He was surrounded with crowds, who showed him only one
side of their character; so that he began to lose a regard for private interest
in universal sympathy. He loved all mankind; for fortune prevented him
from knowing that there were rascals. Physicians tell us of a disorder in
which the whole body is so exquisitely sensible, that the slightest touch gives
pain: what some have thus suffered in their persons, this gentleman felt in his
mind. The slightest distress, whether real or fictitious, touched him to the
quick, and his soul laboured under a sickly sensibility of the miseries of others.
Thus disposed to relieve, it will be easily conjectured he found numbers disposed
to solicit: his profusion began to impair his fortune, but not his good-nature;
that, indeed, was seen to increase as the other seemed to decay; he grew improvident
as he grew poor; and though he talked like a man of sense, his actions
were those of a fool. Still, however, being surrounded with importunity, and
no longer able to satisfy every request that was made him, instead of <i>money</i> he
gave <i>promises</i>. They were all he had to bestow, and he had not resolution
enough to give any man pain by a denial. By this he drew round him crowds
of dependents, whom he was sure to disappoint, yet wished to relieve. These
hung upon him for a time, and left him with merited reproaches and contempt.
But in proportion as he became contemptible to others, he became despicable
to himself. His mind had leaned upon their adulation, and, that support
taken away, he could find no pleasure in the applause of his heart, which he
had never learned to reverence. The world now began to wear a different
aspect; the flattery of his friends began to dwindle into simple approbation.
Approbation soon took the more friendly form of advice; and advice, when
rejected, produced their reproaches. He now, therefore, found that such friends
as benefits had gathered round him were little estimable; he now found that
a man's own heart must be ever given to gain that of another. I now found,
that—that—I forget what I was going to observe; in short, sir, he resolved to
respect himself, and laid down a plan of restoring his falling fortune. For
this purpose, in his own whimsical manner, he travelled through Europe on
foot, and now, though he has scarcely attained the age of thirty, his circumstances
are more affluent than ever. At present his bounties are more rational
and moderate than before; but he still preserves the character of a humourist,
and finds most pleasure in eccentric virtues."</p>

<p class='c009'>My attention was so much taken up by Mr. Burchell's account, that I
<a id='Page_15'></a>scarcely looked forward as we went along, till we were alarmed by the cries of
my family; when, turning, I perceived my youngest daughter in the midst of
a rapid stream, thrown from her horse, and struggling with the torrent. She
had sunk twice, nor was it in my power to disengage myself in time to bring
her relief. My sensations were even too violent to permit my attempting her
rescue: she must have certainly perished, had not my companion, perceiving
her danger, instantly plunged in to her relief, and, with some difficulty,
brought her in safety to the opposite shore. By taking the current a little
farther up, the rest of the family got safely over, where we had an opportunity
of joining our acknowledgments to hers. Her gratitude may be more readily
imagined than described: she thanked her deliverer more with looks than
words, and continued to lean upon his arm, as if still willing to receive
assistance. My wife also hoped one day to have the pleasure of returning his
kindness at her own house. Thus, after we were refreshed at the next inn,
and had dined together, as Mr. Burchell was going to a different part of the
country, he took leave; and we pursued our journey, my wife observing, as he
went, that she liked him extremely, and protesting that, if he had birth and
fortune to entitle him to match into such a family as ours, she knew no man
she would sooner fix upon. I could not but smile to hear her talk in this lofty
strain; but I was never much displeased with those harmless delusions that
tend to make us more happy.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER IV.</i><br /> <br /><i>A proof that even the humblest fortune may grant happiness,<br />which depends not on circumstances, but constitution.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The place of our retreat was in a little neighbourhood, consisting of farmers
who tilled their own grounds, and were equal strangers to opulence and
poverty. As they had almost all the conveniences of life within themselves,
they seldom visited towns or cities in search of superfluities. Remote from
the polite, they still retained the primeval simplicity of manners; and, frugal
by habit, they scarcely knew that temperance was a virtue. They wrought
with cheerfulness on days of labour; but observed festivals as intervals of
idleness and pleasure. They kept up the Christmas carol, sent true-love knots
<a id='Page_16'></a>on Valentine morning, ate pancakes on Shrovetide, showed their wit on the
first of April, and religiously cracked nuts on Michaelmas-eve. Being apprised
of our approach, the whole neighbourhood came out to meet their minister,
dressed in their finest clothes, and preceded by a pipe and tabor; a feast also
was provided for our reception, at which we sat cheerfully down; and what
the conversation wanted in wit was made up in laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our little habitation was situated at the foot of a sloping hill, sheltered
with a beautiful underwood behind, and a prattling river before; on one side
a meadow, on the other a green. My farm consisted of about twenty acres of
excellent land, having given a hundred pounds for my predecessor's goodwill.
Nothing could exceed the neatness of my little enclosures, the elms and hedgerows
appearing with inexpressible beauty. My house consisted of but one
storey, and was covered with thatch, which gave it an air of great snugness;
the walls on the inside were nicely whitewashed, and my daughters undertook
to adorn them with pictures of their own designing. Though the same room
served us for parlour and kitchen, that only made it the warmer. Besides, as
it was kept with the utmost neatness, the dishes, plates, and coppers being
well scoured, and all disposed in bright rows on the shelves, the eye was
agreeably relieved, and did not want richer furniture. There were three other
apartments—one for my wife and me, another for our two daughters within
our own, and the third with two beds for the rest of our children.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little republic to which I gave laws was regulated in the following
manner: by sunrise we all assembled in our common apartment, the fire being
previously kindled by the servant; after we had saluted each other with
proper ceremony—for I always thought fit to keep up some mechanical forms
of good breeding, without which, freedom ever destroys friendship—we all bent
in gratitude to that Being who gave us another day. This duty being performed,
my son and I went to pursue our usual industry abroad, while my
wife and daughters employed themselves in providing breakfast, which was
always ready at a certain time. I allowed half an hour for this meal, and an
hour for dinner; which time was taken up in innocent mirth between my wife
and daughters, and in philosophical arguments between my son and me.</p>

<p>"<i>Sometimes Farmer Flamborough, our talkative neighbour,<br />and often the blind piper, would pay us a visit.</i>"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>As we rose with the sun, so we never pursued our labours after it was gone
down, but returned home to the expecting family; where smiling looks, a neat
hearth, and pleasant fire were prepared for our reception. Nor were we without
guests; sometimes Farmer Flamborough, our talkative neighbour, and often
the blind piper, would pay us a visit, and taste our gooseberry-wine, for the
making of which we had lost neither the recipe nor the reputation. These
harmless people had several ways of being good company; for while one
played, the other would sing some soothing ballad—Johnny Armstrong's Last
<a id='Page_18'></a>Good-night, or the Cruelty of Barbara Allen. The night was concluded in
the manner we began the morning, my youngest boys being appointed to read
the lessons of the day; and he that read loudest, distinctest, and best, was to
have a halfpenny on Sunday to put into the poor's-box.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Sunday came, it was indeed a day of finery, which all my sumptuary
edicts could not restrain. How well soever I fancied my lectures against
pride had conquered the vanity of my daughters, yet I still found them secretly
attached to all their former finery; they still loved laces, ribands, bugles, and
catgut; my wife herself retained a passion for her crimson paduasoy, because
I formerly happend to say it became her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first Sunday, in particular, their behaviour served to mortify me. I
had desired my girls the preceding night to be dressed early the next day; for
I always loved to be at church a good while before the rest of the congregation.
They punctually obeyed my directions; but when we were assembled in the
morning at breakfast, down came my wife and daughters, dressed out in all
their former splendour; their hair plastered up with pomatum, their faces
patched to taste, their trains bundled up into a heap behind, and rustling at
every motion. I could not help smiling at their vanity, particularly that of my
wife, from whom I expected more discretion. In this exigence, therefore, my
only resource was to order my son, with an important air, to call our coach.
The girls were amazed at the command; but I repeated it with more solemnity
than before. "Surely, my dear, you jest," cried my wife; "we can walk it
perfectly well: we want no coach to carry us now." "You mistake, child,"
returned I, "we do want a coach; for if we walk to church in this trim, the
very children in the parish will hoot after us." "Indeed," replied my wife, "I
always imagined that my Charles was fond of seeing his children neat and
handsome about him." "You may be as neat as you please," interrupted I,
"and I shall love you the better for it; but all this is not neatness, but
frippery. These rufflings, and pinkings, and patchings, will only make us hated
by all the wives of our neighbours. No, my children," continued I, more
gravely, "those gowns may be altered into something of a plainer cut; for
finery is very unbecoming in us, who want the means of decency. I do not
know whether such flouncing and shredding is becoming even in the rich,
if we consider, upon a moderate calculation, that the nakedness of the
indigent world may be clothed from the trimmings of the vain."</p>

<p class='c009'>This remonstrance had the proper effect: they went with great composure,
that very instant, to change their dress; and the next day I had the satisfaction
<a id='Page_19'></a>of finding my daughters, at their own request, employed in cutting up
their trains into Sunday waistcoats for Dick and Bill, the two little ones;
and, what was still more satisfactory, the gowns seemed improved by this
curtailing.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER V.</i><br /> <br /><i>A new and great acquaintance introduced.—What we place most<br />hopes upon generally proves most fatal.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>At a small distance from the house my predecessor had made a seat overshaded
by a hedge of hawthorn and honeysuckle. Here, when the weather was
fine, and our labour soon finished, we usually sat together to enjoy an extensive
landscape in the calm of the evening. Here, too, we drank tea, which
was now become an occasional banquet; and as we had it but seldom, it
diffused a new joy, the preparation for it being made with no small share of
bustle and ceremony. On these occasions our two little ones always read for
us, and they were regularly served after we had done. Sometimes, to give a
variety to our amusements, the girls sung to the guitar; and while they thus
formed a little concert, my wife and I would stroll down the sloping field, that
was embellished with blue-bells and centaury, talk of our children with
rapture, and enjoy the breeze that wafted both health and harmony.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this manner we began to find that every situation in life may bring its
own peculiar pleasures; every morning waked us to a repetition of toil; but
the evening repaid it with vacant hilarity.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was about the beginning of autumn, on a holiday—for I kept such as
intervals of relaxation from labour—that I had drawn out my family to our
usual place of amusement, and our young musicians began their usual concert.
As we were thus engaged, we saw a stag bound nimbly by, within about
twenty paces of where we were sitting, and, by its panting, it seemed pressed
by the hunters. We had not much time to reflect upon the poor animal's
distress, when we perceived the dogs and horsemen come sweeping along at
some distance behind, and making the very path it had taken. I was instantly
for returning in with my family; but either curiosity or surprise, or some more
hidden motive, held my wife and daughters to their seats. The huntsman,
<a id='Page_20'></a>who rode foremost, passed us with great swiftness, followed by four or five
persons more, who seemed in equal haste. At last, a young gentleman, of a
more genteel appearance than the rest, came forward, and for a while regarding
us, instead of pursuing the chase stopped short, and, giving his horse to
a servant who attended, approached us with a careless, superior air. He
seemed to want no introduction, but was going to salute my daughters as one
certain of a kind reception; but they had early learned the lesson of looking
presumption out of countenance. Upon which he let us know that his
name was Thornhill, and that he was the owner of the estate that lay for some
extent around us. He again, therefore, offered to salute the female part of the
family; and such was the power of fortune and fine clothes, that he found no
second repulse. As his address, though confident, was easy, we soon became
more familiar; and perceiving musical instruments lying near, he begged to
be favoured with a song. As I did not approve of such disproportioned
acquaintances, I winked upon my daughters in order to prevent their compliance;
but my hint was counteracted by one from their mother, so that with
a cheerful air they gave us a favourite song of Dryden's. Mr. Thornhill
seemed highly delighted with their performance and choice, and then took up
the guitar himself. He played but very indifferently; however, my eldest
daughter repaid his former applause with interest, and assured him that his
tones were louder than even those of her master. At this compliment he
bowed, which she returned by a curtsey. He praised her taste, and she
commended his understanding: an age could not have made them better
acquainted: while the fond mother too, equally happy, insisted upon her landlord's
stepping in, and taking a glass of her gooseberry. The whole family
seemed earnest to please him: my girls attempted to entertain him with topics
they thought most modern; while Moses, on the contrary, gave him a question
or two from the ancients, for which he had the satisfaction of being laughed
at; my little ones were no less busy, and fondly stuck close to the stranger.
All my endeavours could scarcely keep their dirty fingers from handling and
tarnishing the lace on his clothes, and lifting up the flaps of his pocket-holes,
to see what was there. At the approach of evening he took leave; but not
till he had requested permission to renew his visit, which, as he was our
landlord, we most readily agreed to.</p>

<p>"<i>Mr. Thornhill was highly delighted with their<br />performance and choice, and then took the guitar himself.</i>"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>As soon as he was gone, my wife called a council on the conduct of the
day. She was of opinion that it was a most fortunate hit; for she had known
even stranger things than that brought to bear. She hoped again to see the
day in which we might hold up our heads with the best of them; and concluded,
she protested she could see no reason why the two Miss Wrinkles
should marry great fortunes, and her children get none. As this last argument
was directed to me, I protested I could see no reason for it neither; nor why
Mr. Simkins got the ten thousand pound prize in the lottery, and we set down
with a blank. "I protest, Charles," cried my wife, "this is the way you
always damp my girls and me when we are in spirits. Tell me, Sophy, my
dear, what do you think of our new visitor? Don't you think he seemed to
be good-natured?" "Immensely so, indeed, mamma," replied she; "I think
<a id='Page_22'></a>he has a great deal to say upon everything, and is never at a loss; and the
more trifling the subject, the more he has to say." "Yes," cried Olivia, "he is
well enough for a man; but, for my part, I don't much like him, he is so
extremely impudent and familiar; but on the guitar he is shocking." These
two last speeches I interpreted by contraries. I found by this, that Sophia
internally despised as much as Olivia secretly admired him. "Whatever may be
your opinions of him, my children," cried I, "to confess the truth, he has not
prepossessed me in his favour. Disproportioned friendships ever terminate in
disgust; and I thought, notwithstanding all his ease, that he seemed perfectly
sensible of the distance between us. Let us keep to companions of our own
rank. There is no character more contemptible than a man that is a fortune-hunter;
and I can see no reason why fortune-hunting women should not be
contemptible too. Thus, at best, we shall be contemptible if his views be
honourable; but if they be otherwise! I should shudder but to think of
that! It is true, I have no apprehensions from the conduct of my children,
but I think there are some from his character." I would have proceeded, but
for the interruption of a servant from the squire, who, with his compliments,
sent us a side of venison, and a promise to dine with us some days after.
This well-timed present pleaded more powerfully in his favour than anything I
had to say could obviate. I therefore continued silent, satisfied with just
having pointed out danger, and leaving it to their own discretion to avoid
it. That virtue which requires to be ever guarded is scarcely worth the
sentinel.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER VI.</i><br /> <br /><i>Happiness of a country fireside.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>As we carried on the former dispute with some degree of warmth, in order
to accommodate matters it was universally agreed that we should have a part
of the venison for supper, and the girls undertook the task with alacrity. "I
am sorry," cried I, "that we have no neighbour or stranger to take part in
this good cheer: feasts of this kind acquire a double relish from hospitality."
"Bless me!" cried my wife, "here comes our good friend, Mr. Burchell, that
saved our Sophia, and that run you down fairly in the argument." "Confute
<a id='Page_23'></a>me in argument, child!" cried I, "you mistake there, my dear; I believe there
are but few that can do that: I never dispute your abilities at making a goose-pie,
and I beg you'll leave argument to me." As I spoke poor Mr. Burchell
entered the house, and was welcomed by the family, who shook him heartily
by the hand, while little Dick officiously reached him a chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was pleased with the poor man's friendship for two reasons: because I
knew that he wanted mine, and I knew him to be friendly as far as he was
able. He was known in our neighbourhood by the character of the poor
gentleman that would do no good when he was young, though he was not yet
thirty. He would at intervals talk with great good sense; but in general he
was fondest of the company of children, whom he used to call harmless little
men. He was famous, I found, for singing them ballads and telling them
stories; and seldom went out without something in his pockets for them—a
piece of gingerbread, or a halfpenny whistle. He generally came for a few
days into our neighbourhood once a year, and lived upon the neighbours'
hospitality. He sat down to supper among us, and my wife was not sparing
of her gosseberry-wine. The tale went round; he sung us old songs, and
gave the children the story of the Buck of Beverland, with the History of Patient
Grizzel, the Adventures of Catskin, and then Fair Rosamond's Bower. Our
cock, which always crew at eleven, now told us it was time for repose; but an
unforeseen difficulty started about lodging the stranger: all our beds were
already taken up, and it was too late to send him to the next alehouse. In
this dilemma, little Dick offered him his part of the bed, if his brother Moses
would let him lie with him. "And I," cried Bill, "will give Mr. Burchell my
part, if my sisters will take me to theirs." "Well done, my good children," cried
I, "hospitality is one of the first Christian duties. The beast retires to its shelter,
and the bird flies to its nest; but helpless man can only find refuge from his
fellow-creature. The greatest stranger in this world was He that came to save
it: He never had a house, as if willing to see what hospitality was left remaining
amongst us. Deborah, my dear," cried I to my wife, "give those boys a
lump of sugar each; and let Dick's be the largest, because he spoke first."</p>

<p class='c009'>In the morning early, I called out my whole family to help at saving an
after-growth of hay, and our guest offering his assistance, he was accepted
among the number. Our labours went on lightly; we turned the swath to
the wind; I went foremost, and the rest followed in due succession. I could
not avoid, however, observing the assiduity of Mr. Burchell in aiding my
daughter Sophia in her part of the task. When he had finished his own, he
<a id='Page_24'></a>would join in hers, and enter into a close conversation: but I had too good an
opinion of Sophia's understanding, and was too well convinced of her ambition,
to be under any uneasiness from a man of broken fortune. When we were
finished for the day, Mr. Burchell was invited as on the night before, but he
refused, as he was to lie that night at a neighbour's, to whose child he was
carrying a whistle. When gone, our conversation at supper turned upon our
late unfortunate guest. "What a strong instance," said I, "is that poor man
of the miseries attending a youth of levity and extravagance! He by no
means wants sense, which only serves to aggravate his former folly. Poor
forlorn creature! where are now the revellers, the flatterers, that he could
once inspire and command? Gone, perhaps, to attend the bagnio pandar,
grown rich by his extravagance. They once praised him, and now they
applaud the pandar: their former raptures at his wit are now converted into
sarcasms at his folly: he is poor, and perhaps deserves poverty; for he has
neither the ambition to be independent nor the skill to be useful." Prompted
perhaps by some secret reasons, I delivered this observation with too much
acrimony, which my Sophia gently reproved. "Whatsoever his former conduct
may have been, papa, his circumstances should exempt him from censure now.
His present indigence is a sufficient punishment for former folly: and I have
heard my papa himself say, that we should never strike one unnecessary blow
at a victim over whom Providence holds the scourge of its resentment." "You
are right, Sophy," cried my son Moses; "and one of the ancients finely
represents so malicious a conduct, by the attempts of a rustic to flay Marsyas,
whose skin, the fable tells us, had been wholly stripped off by another;
besides, I don't know if this poor man's situation be so bad as my father
would represent it. We are not to judge of the feelings of others by what we
might feel if in their place. However dark the habitation of the mole to our
eyes, yet the animal itself finds the apartments sufficiently lightsome. And, to
confess the truth, this man's mind seems fitted to his station; for I never
heard any one more sprightly than he was to-day, when he conversed with
you." This was said without the least design: however, it excited a blush,
which she strove to cover by an affected laugh; assuring him that she scarcely
took any notice of what he said to her, but that she believed he might once
have been a very fine gentleman. The readiness with which she undertook to
vindicate herself, and her blushing, were symptoms I did not internally
approve; but I repressed my suspicions.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>As we expected our landlord the next day, my wife went to make the
venison-pasty; Moses sat reading, while I taught the little ones: my daughters
seemed equally busy with the rest; and I observed them for a good while
cooking something over the fire. I at first supposed they were assisting their
<a id='Page_26'></a>mother; but little Dick informed me, in a whisper, that they were making a
wash for the face. Washes of all kinds I had a natural antipathy to; for I
knew that, instead of mending the complexion, they spoiled it. I therefore
approached my chair by slow degrees to the fire, and grasping the poker, as
if it wanted mending, seemingly by accident overturned the whole composition,
and it was too late to begin another.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER VII.</i><br /> <br /><i>A town wit described.—The dullest fellows may learn<br />to be comical for a night or two.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>When the morning arrived on which we were to entertain our young landlord,
it may be easily supposed what provisions were exhausted to make an appearance.
It may be also conjectured, that my wife and daughters expanded their
gayest plumage on this occasion. Mr. Thornhill came with a couple of friends,
his chaplain and feeder. The servants, who were numerous, he politely ordered
to the next alehouse: but my wife, in the triumph of her heart, insisted on
entertaining them all; for which, by the bye, our family was pinched for three
weeks after. As Mr. Burchell had hinted to us, the day before, that he was
making some proposals of marriage to Miss Wilmot, my son George's former
mistress, this a good deal damped the heartiness of his reception: but accident
in some measure relieved our embarrassment; for one of the company
happening to mention her name, Mr. Thornhill observed with an oath, that he
never knew anything more absurd than calling such a fright a beauty. "For,
strike me ugly!" continued he, "if I should not find as much pleasure in
choosing my mistress by the information of a lamp under the clock of St.
Dunstan's." At this he laughed, and so did we: the jests of the rich are
ever successful. Olivia, too, could not avoid whispering, loud enough to be
heard, that he had an infinite fund of humour.</p>

<p class='c009'>After dinner, I began with my usual toast, the Church; for this I was
thanked by the chaplain, as he said the Church was the only mistress of his
affections. "Come, tell us honestly, Frank," said the squire, with his usual
archness, "suppose the Church, your present mistress, dressed in lawn sleeves,
<a id='Page_27'></a>on one hand, and Miss Sophia, with no lawn about her, on the other, which
would you be for?" "For both, to be sure," cried the chaplain, "Right,
Frank!" cried the squire; "for may this glass suffocate me, but a fine girl is
worth all the priestcraft in the creation; for what are tithes and tricks but an
imposition, all a confounded imposture? and I can prove it." "I wish you
would," cried my son Moses; "and I think," continued he, "that I should
be able to answer you." "Very well, sir," cried the squire, who immediately
smoked him, and winked on the rest of the company to prepare us for the
sport: "if you are for a cool argument upon the subject, I am ready to accept
the challenge. And first, whether are you for managing it analogically or
dialogically?" "I am for managing it rationally," cried Moses, quite happy
at being permitted to dispute. "Good again!" cried the squire; "and, firstly,
of the first I hope you'll not deny that whatever is, is: if you don't grant me
that, I can go no further." "Why," returned Moses, "I think I may grant
that, and make the best of it." "I hope, too," returned the other, "you will
grant that a part is less than the whole?" "I grant that too," cried Moses: "it
is but just and reasonable." "I hope," cried the squire, "you will not deny,
that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones?" "Nothing
can be plainer," returned t'other, and looked round him with his usual
importance. "Very well," cried the squire, speaking very quick; "the
premises being thus settled, I proceed to observe, that the concatenation of
self-existences, proceeding in a reciprocal duplicate ratio, naturally produce a
problematical dialogism, which, in some measure, proves that the essence of
spirituality may be referred to the second predicable." "Hold, hold!" cried
the other, "I deny that. Do you think I can thus tamely submit to such
heterodox doctrines?" "What!" replied the squire, as if in a passion, "not
submit! Answer me one plain question. Do you think Aristotle right when
he says that relatives are related?" "Undoubtedly," replied the other.
"If so, then," cried the squire, "answer me directly to what I propose:
Whether do you judge the analytical investigation of the first part of my
enthymem deficient <i>secundum quoad</i>, or <i>quoad minus</i>? and give me your
reasons, I say, directly." "I protest," cried Moses, "I don't rightly comprehend
the force of your reasoning; but if it be reduced to one single,
proposition, I fancy it may then have an answer." "Oh, sir," cried the squire,
"I am your most humble servant: I find you want me to furnish you with
argument and intellects too. No, sir! there I protest you are too hard for
me." This effectually raised the laugh against poor Moses, who sat the only
<a id='Page_28'></a>dismal figure in a group of merry faces; nor did he offer a single syllable
more during the whole entertainment.</p>

<p class='c009'>But though all this gave me no pleasure, it had a very different effect upon
Olivia, who mistook it for humour, though but a mere act of memory. She
thought him, therefore, a very fine gentleman; and such as consider what
powerful ingredients a good figure, fine clothes, and fortune are in that
character, will easily forgive her. Mr. Thornhill, notwithstanding his real
ignorance, talked with ease, and could expatiate upon the common topics
of conversation with fluency. It is not surprising, then, that such talents
should win the affections of a girl who, by education, was taught to value
an appearance in herself, and consequently to set a value upon it in
another.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon his departure, we again entered into a debate upon the merits
of our young landlord. As he directed his looks and conversation to Olivia,
it was no longer doubted but that she was the object that induced him
to be our visitor. Nor did she seem to be much displeased at the innocent
raillery of her brother and sister upon this occasion. Even Deborah herself
seemed to share the glory of the day, and exulted in her daughter's victory, as
if it were her own. "And now, my dear," cried she to me, "I'll fairly own
that it was I who instructed my girls to encourage our landlord's addresses. I
had always some ambition, and you now see that I was right; for who knows
how this may end?" "Ay, who knows that, indeed!" answered I, with a
groan: "for my part, I don't much like it; and I could have been better
pleased with one that was poor and honest, than this fine gentleman with his
fortune and infidelity; for, depend on't, if he be what I suspect him, no freethinker
shall ever have a child of mine."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Sure, father," cried Moses, "You are too severe in this; for Heaven will
never arraign him for what he thinks, but for what he does. Every man has a
thousand vicious thoughts, which arise without his power to suppress. Thinking
freely of religion may be involuntary with this gentleman; so that,
allowing his sentiments to be wrong, yet, as he is purely passive in his
assent, he is no more to be blamed for his errors than the governor of a city
without walls for the shelter he is obliged to afford an invading enemy."</p>

<p class='c009'>"True, my son," cried I; "but if the governor invites the enemy there,
he is justly culpable; and such is always the case with those who embrace
error. The vice does not lie in assenting to the proofs they see, but in being
blind to many of the proofs that offer. So that, though our erroneous opinions
<a id='Page_29'></a>be involuntary when formed, yet, as we have been wilfully corrupt or very
negligent in forming them, we deserve punishment for our vice, or contempt
for our folly."</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>My wife now kept up the conversation, though not the argument: she
observed, that several very prudent men of our acquaintance were freethinkers,
and made very good husbands; and she knew some sensible girls that had had
skill enough to make converts of their spouses. "And who knows, my dear,"
continued she, "what Olivia may be able to do? The girl has a great deal
to say upon every subject, and, to my knowledge, is very well skilled in
controversy."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_30'></a>"Why, my dear, what controversy can she have read? "cried I. "It
does not occur to me that I ever put such books into her hands: you certainly
over-rate her merit." "Indeed, papa," replied Olivia, "she does not; I have
read a great deal of controversy. I have read the disputes between Thwackum
and Square; the controversy between Robinson Crusoe and Friday the
savage; and I am now employed in reading the controversy in 'Religious
Courtship.'" "Very well," cried I: "that's a good girl; I find you are
perfectly qualified for making converts, and so go help your mother to make

  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER VIII.</i><br /> <br /><i>An amour, which promises little good fortune,<br />yet may be productive of much.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The next morning we were again visited by Mr. Burchell, though I began, for
certain reasons, to be displeased with the frequency of his return; but I could
not refuse him my company and my fireside. It is true, his labour more
than requited his entertainment; for he wrought among us with vigour, and,
either in the meadow or at the hay-rick, put himself foremost. Besides, he
had always something amusing to say that lessened our toil, and was at once
so out of the way, and yet so sensible, that I loved, laughed at, and pitied
him. My only dislike arose from an attachment he discovered to my daughter:
he would, in a jesting manner, call her his little mistress; and when
he bought each of the girls a set of ribands, hers was the finest. I knew
not how, but he every day seemed to become more amiable, his wit to improve,
and his simplicity to assume the superior airs of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our family dined in the field, and we sat, or rather reclined, round a
temperate repast, our cloth spread upon the hay, while Mr. Burchell gave cheerfulness
to the feast. To heighten our satisfaction, two blackbirds answered
each other from the opposite hedges, the familiar redbreast came and pecked
the crumbs from our hands, and every sound seemed but the echo of tranquillity.
"I never sit thus," says Sophia, "but I think of the two lovers, so
sweetly described by Mr. Gay, who were struck dead in each other's arms.
There is something so pathetic in the description, that I have read it a
hundred times with new rapture." "In my opinion," cried my son, "the
<a id='Page_31'></a>finest strokes in that description are much below those in the 'Acis and Galatea'
of Ovid. The Roman poet understands the use of <i>contrast</i> better, and upon
that figure, artfully managed, all strength in the pathetic depends." "It is
remarkable," cried Mr. Burchell, "that both the poets you mention have
equally contributed to introduce a false taste into their respective countries, by
loading all their lines with epithet. Men of little genius found them most
easily imitated in their defects; and English poetry, like that in the latter
empire of Rome, is nothing at present but a combination of luxuriant images,
without plot or connection—a string of epithets that improve the sound without
carrying on the sense. But perhaps, madam, while I thus reprehend others,
you'll think it just that I should give them an opportunity to retaliate; and,
indeed, I have made this remark only to have an opportunity of introducing
to the company a ballad, which, whatever be its other defects, is, I think, at
least free from those I have mentioned."</p>

<p>"<i>Two young ladies richly dressed, whom<br />he introduced as women of very great<br />distinction and fashion from town.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 35.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>While this ballad was reading, Sophia seemed to mix an air of tenderness
with her approbation. But our tranquillity was soon disturbed by the report
of a gun just by us; and, immediately after, a man was seen bursting through
<a id='Page_35'></a>the hedge to take up the game he had killed. This sportsman was the squire's
chaplain, who had shot one of the blackbirds that so agreeably entertained us.
So loud a report, and so near, startled my daughters; and I could perceive
that Sophia, in the fright, had thrown herself into Mr. Burchell's arms for
protection. The gentleman came up, and asked pardon for having disturbed
us, affirming that he was ignorant of our being so near. He therefore sat
down by my youngest daughter, and, sportsman like, offered her what he had
killed that morning. She was going to refuse, but a private look from her
mother soon induced her to correct the mistake, and accept his present, though
with some reluctance. My wife, as usual, discovered her pride in a whisper;
observing that Sophy had made a conquest of the chaplain, as well as her
sister had of the squire. I suspected, however, with more probability, that
her affections were placed upon a different object. The chaplain's errand was
to inform us that Mr. Thornhill had provided music and refreshments, and
intended that night giving the young ladies a ball by moonlight on the grass-plot
before our door. "Nor can I deny," continued he, "that I have an
interest in being first to deliver this message, as I expect for my reward to be
honoured with Miss Sophia's hand as a partner." To this my girl replied
that she should have no objection, "if she could do it with honour. But
here," continued she, "is a gentleman," looking at Mr. Burchell, "who has
been my companion in the task of the day, and it is fit he should share in its
amusements." Mr. Burchell returned her a compliment for her intentions,
but resigned her up to the chaplain, adding, that he was to go that night five
miles, being invited to a harvest supper. His refusal appeared to me a little
extraordinary; nor could I conceive how so sensible a girl as my youngest
could thus prefer a man of broken fortunes to one whose expectations were
much greater. But as men are most capable of distinguishing merit in
women, so the ladies often form the truest judgment of us. The two sexes
seem placed as spies upon each other, and are furnished with different abilities,
adapted for mutual inspection.</p>

  <a id='Page_36'></a>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER IX.</i><br /> <br /><i>Two ladies of great distinction introduced.—Superior<br />finery ever seems to confer superior breeding</i>.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Mr. Burchell had scarcely taken leave, and Sophia consented to dance with
the chaplain, when my little ones came running out to tell us that the squire
was come with a crowd of company. Upon our return, we found our landlord
with a couple of under-gentlemen and two young ladies richly dressed, whom
he introduced as women of very great distinction and fashion from town. We
happened not to have chairs enough for the whole company; but Mr. Thornhill
immediately proposed that every gentleman should sit in a lady's lap.
This I positively objected to, notwithstanding a look of disapprobation from
my wife. Moses was therefore despatched to borrow a couple of chairs; and,
as we were in want of ladies to make up a set at country-dances, the two
gentlemen went with him in quest of a couple of partners. Chairs and
partners were soon provided. The gentlemen returned with my neighbour
Flamborough's rosy daughters, flaunting with red top-knots. But an unlucky
circumstance was not adverted to: though the Miss Flamboroughs were
reckoned the very best dancers in the parish, and understood the jig and the
round-about to perfection, yet they were totally unacquainted with country-dances.
This at first discomposed us; however, after a little shoving and
dragging, they at last went merrily on. Our music consisted of two fiddles,
with a pipe and tabor. The moon shone bright: Mr. Thornhill and my eldest
daughter led up the ball, to the great delight of the spectators; for the neighbours,
hearing what was going forward, came flocking about us. My girl
moved with so much grace and vivacity, that my wife could not avoid
discovering the pride of her heart, by assuring me that, though the little chit
did it so cleverly, all the steps were stolen from herself. The ladies of the
town strove hard to be equally easy, but without success. They swam,
sprawled, languished, and frisked; but all would not do: the gazers, indeed,
owned that it was fine; but neighbour Flamborough observed that Miss
Livy's feet seemed as pat to the music as its echo. After the dance had
continued about an hour, the two ladies, who were apprehensive of catching
cold, moved to break up the ball. One of them, I thought, expressed her
sentiments upon this occasion in a very coarse manner, when she observed,
that, by the <i>living jingo, she was all of a muck of sweat</i>. Upon our return to
<a id='Page_37'></a>the house we found a very elegant cold supper, which Mr. Thornhill had
ordered to be brought with him. The conversation at this time was more
reserved than before. The two ladies threw my girls quite into the shade:
for they would talk of nothing but high life and high-lived company; with
other fashionable topics, such as pictures, taste, Shakespeare, and the musical
glasses. 'Tis true, they once or twice mortified us sensibly by slipping out an
oath; but that appeared to me as the surest symptom of their distinction
(though I am since informed that swearing is perfectly unfashionable). Their
finery, however, threw a veil over any grossness in their conversation. My
daughters seemed to regard their superior accomplishments with envy; and
whatever appeared amiss was ascribed to tip-top quality breeding. But the
condescension of the ladies was still superior to their other accomplishments.
One of them observed, that, had Miss Olivia seen a little more of the world, it
would greatly improve her. To which the other added, that a single winter
in town would make her little Sophia quite another thing. My wife warmly
assented to both; adding that there was nothing she more ardently wished
than to give her girls a single winter's polishing. To this I could not help
replying that their breeding was already superior to their fortune; and that
greater refinement would only serve to make their poverty ridiculous, and
give them a taste for pleasures they had no right to possess. "And what
pleasures," cried Mr. Thornhill, "do they not deserve to possess, who have so
much in their power to bestow? As for my part," continued he, "my fortune
is pretty large; love, liberty, and pleasure are my maxims; but, curse me! if
a settlement of half my estate could give my charming Olivia pleasure, it
should be hers; and the only favour I would ask in return would be to add
myself to the benefit." I was not such a stranger to the world as to be
ignorant that this was the fashionable cant to disguise the insolence of the
basest proposal; but I made an effort to suppress my resentment. "Sir,"
cried I, "the family which you now condescend to favour with your company
has been bred with as nice a sense of honour as you. Any attempts to injure
that may be attended with very dangerous consequences. Honour, sir, is our
only possession at present, and of that last treasure we must be particularly
careful." I was soon sorry for the warmth with which I had spoken this,
when the young gentleman, grasping my hand, swore he commended my
spirit, though he disapproved my suspicions. "As to your present hint,"
continued he, "I protest nothing was further from my heart than such a
thought. No, by all that's tempting, the virtue that will stand a regular
<a id='Page_38'></a>siege was never to my taste; for all my amours are carried by a
<i>coup-de-main</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>The tawny sybil no sooner appeared than<br />my girls came running to me for a shilling<br />a-piece to cross her hand with silver.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 38.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The two ladies, who affected to be ignorant of the rest, seemed highly
displeased with this last stroke of freedom, and began a very discreet and
serious dialogue upon virtue. In this my wife, the chaplain, and I soon joined;
and the squire himself was at last brought to confess a sense of sorrow for his
former excesses. We talked of the pleasures of temperance, and of the
sunshine in the mind unpolluted with guilt. I was so well pleased, that my
little ones were kept up beyond the usual time to be edified by so much good
<a id='Page_39'></a>conversation. Mr. Thornhill even went beyond me, and demanded if I had
any objection to giving prayers. I joyfully embraced the proposal; and in
this manner the night was passed in a most comfortable way, till at length
the company began to think of returning. The ladies seemed very unwilling
to part with my daughters, for whom they had conceived a particular affection,
and joined in a request to have the pleasure of their company home.
The squire seconded the proposal, and my wife added her entreaties; the
girls, too, looked upon me as if they wished to go. In this perplexity I
made two or three excuses, which my daughters as readily removed; so that
at last I was obliged to give a peremptory refusal; for which we had nothing
but sullen looks and short answers for the whole day ensuing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER X.</i><br /> <br /><i>The family endeavour to cope with their betters.—The<br />miseries of the poor when they attempt to appear above<br />their circumstances.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>I now began to find that all my long and painful lectures upon temperance,
simplicity, and contentment, were entirely disregarded. The distinctions
lately paid us by our betters awakened that pride which I had laid asleep, but
not removed. Our windows again, as formerly, were filled with washes for
the neck and face. The sun was dreaded as an enemy to the skin without
doors, and the fire as a spoiler of the complexion within. My wife observed,
that rising too early would hurt her daughters' eyes, that working after dinner
would redden their noses, and she convinced me that the hands never looked
so white as when they did nothing. Instead, therefore, of finishing George's
shirts, we now had them new-modelling their old gauzes, or flourishing upon
catgut. The poor Miss Flamboroughs, their former gay companions, were
cast off as mean acquaintance, and the whole conversation now ran upon high
life and high-lived company, with pictures, taste, Shakespeare, and the
musical glasses.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we could have borne all this had not a fortune-telling gipsy come
to raise us into perfect sublimity. The tawny sybil no sooner appeared than
my girls came running to me for a shilling a-piece to cross her hand with
silver. To say the truth, I was tired of being always wise, and could not
<a id='Page_40'></a>help gratifying their request, because I loved to see them happy. I gave each
of them a shilling; though, for the honour of the family, it must be observed
that they never went without money themselves, as my wife always generously
let them have a guinea each to keep in their pockets, but with strict injunctions
never to change it. After they had been closeted up with the fortune-teller
for some time, I knew by their looks, upon their returning, that they
had been promised something great. "Well, my girls, how have you sped?
Tell me, Livy, has the fortune-teller given thee a pennyworth?" "I protest,
papa," says the girl, "I believe she deals with somebody that's not right; for
she positively declared that I am to be married to a squire in less than a
twelvemonth!" "Well, now, Sophy, my child," said I, "and what sort of a
husband are you to have?" "Sir," replied she, "I am to have a lord soon
after my sister has married the squire." "How!" cried I, "is that all you are
to have for your two shillings? Only a lord and a squire for two shillings?
You fools, I could have promised you a prince and a nabob for half
the money."</p>

<p class='c009'>This curiosity of theirs, however, was attended with very serious effects:
we now began to think ourselves designed by the stars to something exalted,
and already anticipated our future grandeur.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has been a thousand times observed, and I must observe it once more,
that the hours we pass with happy prospects in view are more pleasing than
those crowned with fruition. In the first case, we cook the dish to our own
appetite; in the latter, nature cooks it for us. It is impossible to repeat the
train of agreeable reveries we called up for our entertainment. We looked
upon our fortunes as once more rising; and as the whole parish asserted that
the squire was in love with my daughter, she was actually so with him; for
they persuaded her into the passion. In this agreeable interval my wife had
the most lucky dreams in the world, which she took care to tell us every
morning with great solemnity and exactness. It was one night a coffin and
cross-bones, the sign of an approaching wedding; at another time she imagined
her daughters' pockets filled with farthings, a certain sign that they would
shortly be stuffed with gold. The girls themselves had their omens: they felt
strange kisses on their lips; they saw rings in the candle; purses bounced
from the fire; and true-love knots lurked in the bottom of every tea-cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>Towards the end of the week we received a card from the town ladies, in
which, with their compliments, they hoped to see all our family at church the
Sunday following. All Saturday morning I could perceive, in consequence of
<a id='Page_41'></a>this, my wife and daughters in close conference together, and now and then
glancing at me with looks that betrayed a latent plot. To be sincere, I had
strong suspicions that some absurd proposal was preparing for appearing with
splendour the next day. In the evening they began their operations in a very
regular manner, and my wife undertook to conduct the siege. After tea, when
I seemed in spirits, she began thus: "I fancy, Charles, my dear, we shall have
a great deal of good company at our church to-morrow." "Perhaps we may,
my dear," returned I; "though you need be under no uneasiness about that—you
shall have a sermon whether there be or not." "That is what I
expect," returned she; "but I think, my dear, we ought to appear there as
decently as possible, for who knows what may happen?" "Your precautions,"
replied I, "are highly commendable. A decent behaviour and appearance at
church is what charms me. We should be devout and humble, cheerful and
serene." "Yes," cried she, "I know that; but I mean we should go there in
as proper a manner as possible; not altogether like the scrubs about us."
"You are quite right, my dear," returned I, "and I was going to make the
very same proposal. The proper manner of going is, to go there as early as
possible, to have time for meditation before the service begins." "Phoo!
Charles," interrupted she, "all that is very true, but not what I would be at.
I mean, we should go there genteelly. You know the church is two miles off,
and I protest I don't like to see my daughters trudging up to their pew all
blowzed and red with walking, and looking for all the world as if they had
been winners at a smock-race. Now, my dear, my proposal is this—there are
our two plough-horses, the colt that has been in our family these nine years,
and his companion Blackberry, that has scarcely done an earthly thing for this
month past; they are both grown fat and lazy: why should they not do
something as well as we? And let me tell you, when Moses has trimmed
them a little they will cut a very tolerable figure."</p>

<p class='c009'>To this proposal I objected that walking would be twenty times more
genteel than such a paltry conveyance, as Blackberry was wall-eyed, and the
colt wanted a tail; that they had never been broke to the rein, but had a
hundred vicious tricks; and that we had but one saddle and pillion in the
whole house. All these objections, however, were overruled; so that I was
obliged to comply. The next morning I perceived them not a little busy in
collecting such materials as might be necessary for the expedition; but, as I
found it would be a work of time, I walked on to the church before, and they
promised speedily to follow. I waited near an hour in the reading desk for
their arrival; but, not finding them come as was expected, I was obliged to
begin, and went through the service, not without some uneasiness at finding
them absent.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><a id='Page_43'></a>This was increased when all was finished, and no appearance of the
family. I therefore walked back by the horse-way, which was five miles
round, though the footway was but two; and when I got about half way home,
perceived the procession marching slowly forward towards the church—my
son, my wife, and the two little ones exalted upon one horse, and my two
daughters upon the other. I demanded the cause of their delay; but I soon
found by their looks they had met with a thousand misfortunes on the road.
The horses had at first refused to move from the door, till Mr. Burchell was
kind enough to beat them forward for about two hundred yards with his
cudgel. Next the straps of my wife's pillion broke down, and they were
obliged to stop to repair them before they could proceed. After that, one of
the horses took it into his head to stand still, and neither blows nor entreaties
could prevail with him to proceed. They were just recovering from this dismal
situation when I found them; but perceiving everything safe, I own their
present mortification did not much displease me, as it would give me many
opportunities of future triumph, and teach my daughters more humility.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XI.</i><br /> <br /><i>The family still resolve to hold up their heads.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Michaelmas-Eve happening on the next day, we were invited to burn nuts
and play tricks at neighbour Flamborough's. Our late mortifications had
humbled us a little, or it is probable we might have rejected such an invitation
with contempt: however, we suffered ourselves to be happy. Our honest
neighbour's goose and dumplings were fine; and the lamb's-wool, even in the
opinion of my wife, who was a connoisseur, was excellent. It is true, his
manner of telling stories was not quite so well. They were very long and
very dull, and all about himself, and we had laughed at them ten times
before; however, we were kind enough to laugh at them once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Burchell, who was of the party, was always fond of seeing some
innocent amusement going forward, and set the boys and girls to blindman's
buff. My wife too was persuaded to join in the diversion, and it gave me
pleasure to think that she was not yet too old. In the meantime, my
neighbour and I looked on, laughed at every feat, and praised our own
<a id='Page_44'></a>dexterity when we were young. Hot cockles succeeded next, questions and
commands followed that, and, last of all, they sat down to hunt the slipper.
As every person may not be acquainted with this primeval pastime, it may be
necessary to observe, that the company at this play plant themselves in a ring
upon the ground, all except one who stands in the middle, whose business it
is to catch a shoe which the company shove about under their hams from one
to another, something like a weaver's shuttle. As it is impossible, in this
case, for the lady who is up to face all the company at once, the great beauty
of the play lies in hitting her a thump with the heel of the shoe on that side
least capable of making a defence. It was in this manner that my eldest
daughter was hemmed in, and thumped about, all blowzed, in spirits, and
bawling for fair play with a voice that might deafen a ballad-singer, when,
confusion on confusion! who should enter the room but our two great
acquaintances from town, Lady Blarney and Miss Carolina Wilhelmina
Amelia Skeggs! Description would but beggar, therefore it is unnecessary
to describe this new mortification.—Death! to be seen by ladies of such
high breeding in such vulgar attitudes! Nothing better could ensue from
such a vulgar play of Mr. Flamborough's proposing. We seemed stuck to
the ground for some time, as if actually petrified with amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two ladies had been at our house to see us, and finding us from home,
came after us hither, as they were uneasy to know what accident could have
kept us from church the day before. Olivia undertook to be our prolocutor,
and delivered the whole in a summary way, only saying, "We were thrown
from our horses." At which account the ladies were greatly concerned; but
being told the family received no hurt, they were extremely glad; but being
informed that we were almost killed with fright, they were vastly sorry; but
hearing that we had a very good night, they were extremely glad again.
Nothing could exceed their complaisance to my daughters: their professions
the last evening were warm, but now they were ardent. They protested a
desire of having a more lasting acquaintance. Lady Blarney was particularly
attached to Olivia; Miss Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs (I love to give the
whole name) took a greater fancy to her sister. They supported the conversation
between themselves, while my daughters sat silent, admiring their
exalted breeding. But as every reader, however beggarly himself, is fond of
high-lived dialogues, with anecdotes of lords, ladies, and knights of the
garter, I must beg leave to give him the concluding part of the present
conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_45'></a>"All that I know of the matter," cried Miss Skeggs, "is this, that it may
be true, or it may not be true: but this I can assure your ladyship, that the
whole rout was in amaze; his lordship turned all manner of colours, my lady
fell into a swoon; but Sir Tomkyn, drawing his sword, swore he was hers to
the last drop of his blood."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Well," replied our peeress, "this I can say, that the duchess never told
me a syllable of the matter, and I believe her grace would keep nothing a
secret from me. This you may depend upon as fact, that the next morning
my lord duke cried out three times to his valet-de-chambre, 'Jernigan!
Jernigan! Jernigan! bring me my garters.'"</p>

<p class='c009'>But previously I should have mentioned the very impolite behaviour of
Mr. Burchell, who, during this discourse, sat with his face turned to the fire,
and at the conclusion of every sentence would cry out <i>Fudge!</i> an expression
which displeased us all, and in some measure damped the rising spirit of the
conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Besides, my dear Skeggs," continued our peeress, "there is nothing of
this in the copy of verses that Dr. Burdock made upon the occasion."—<i>Fudge!</i></p>

<p class='c009'>"I am surprised at that," cried Miss Skeggs; "for he seldom leaves anything
out, as he writes only for his own amusement. But can your ladyship
favour me with a sight of them?"—<i>Fudge!</i></p>

<p class='c009'>"My dear creature," replied our peeress, "do you think I carry such
things about me? Though they are very fine to be sure, and I think myself
something of a judge: at least I know what pleases myself. Indeed, I was
ever an admirer of all Dr. Burdock's little pieces; for except what he does,
and our dear countess at Hanover-square, there's nothing comes out but the
most lowest stuff in nature; not a bit of high life among them."—<i>Fudge!</i></p>

<p class='c009'>"Your ladyship should except," says t'other, "your own things in the
'Lady's Magazine.' I hope you'll say there's nothing low-lived there! But I
suppose we are to have no more from that quarter?"—<i>Fudge!</i></p>

<p class='c009'>"Why, my dear," says the lady, "you know my reader and companion has
left me to be married to Captain Roach, and as my poor eyes won't suffer me
to write myself, I have been for some time looking out for another. A proper
person is no easy matter to find, and to be sure thirty pounds a year is
a small stipend for a well-bred girl of character that can read, write, and
behave in company; as for the chits about town, there is no bearing them
about one."—<i>Fudge!</i></p>

<p class='c009'>"That I know," cried Miss Skeggs, "by experience; for of the three
<a id='Page_46'></a>companions I had this last half-year, one of them refused to do plain work an
hour in a day; another thought twenty-five guineas a year too small a salary;
and I was obliged to send away the third, because I suspected an intrigue with
the chaplain. Virtue, my dear Lady Blarney, virtue is worth any price; but
where is that to be found?"—<i>Fudge!</i></p>

<div  class='figcenter id017'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>"<i>We had at last the satisfaction of seeing<br />him mounted upon the colt, with a deal box<br />before him to bring home groceries in.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 48.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>My wife had been for a long time all attention to this discourse, but was
particularly struck with the latter part of it. Thirty pounds and twenty-five
guineas a year, made fifty-six pounds five shillings English money; all which
was in a manner going a begging, and might easily be secured in the family.
She for a moment studied my looks of approbation; and, to own the truth,
I was of opinion that two such places would fit our two daughters exactly.
Besides, if the squire had any real affection for my eldest daughter, this
would be the way to make her every way qualified for her fortune. My wife,
<a id='Page_47'></a>therefore, was resolved that we should not be deprived of such advantages
for want of assurance, and undertook to harangue for the family. "I hope,"
cried she, "your ladyship will pardon my present presumption. It is true, we
have no right to pretend to such favours, but yet it is natural for me to wish
putting my children forward in the world. And I will be bold to say, my two
girls have had a pretty good education, and capacity; at least the country can't
show better. They can read, write, and cast accounts; they understand their
needle, broad-stitch, cross, and change, and all manner of plain work; they
can pink, point, and frill; and know something of music; they can do up
small clothes and work upon catgut; my eldest can cut paper, and my
youngest has a very pretty manner of telling fortunes upon the cards?"
—<i>Fudge!</i></p>

<p class='c009'>When she had delivered this pretty piece of eloquence, the two ladies
looked at each other a few minutes in silence, with an air of doubt and importance.
At last Miss Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs condescended
to observe, that the young ladies, from the opinion she could form of them
from so slight an acquaintance, seemed very fit for such employments: "but
a thing of this kind, madam," cried she, addressing my spouse, "requires a
thorough examination into characters, and a more perfect knowledge of each
other. Not, madam," continued she, "that I in the least suspect the young
ladies' virtue, prudence, and discretion; but there is a form in these things,
madam; there is a form."—<i>Fudge!</i></p>

<p class='c009'>My wife approved her suspicions very much, observing that she was
very apt to be suspicious herself; but referred her to all the neighbours for
a character; but this our peeress declined as unnecessary, alleging that her
cousin Thornhill's recommendation would be sufficient, and upon this we rested
our petition.</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'>When we returned home, the night was dedicated to schemes of future
conquest. Deborah exerted much sagacity in conjecturing which of the two
girls was likely to have the best place and most opportunities of seeing good
company. The only obstacle to our preferment was in obtaining the squire's
recommendation; but he had already shown us too many instances of his
friendship to doubt of it now. Even in bed my wife kept up the usual
theme. "Well, faith, my dear Charles, between ourselves, I think we have
made an excellent day's work of it." "Pretty well," cried I, not knowing
what to say. "What, only pretty well!" returned she, "I think it is very
well. Suppose the girls should come to make acquaintance of taste in town?
This I am assured of, that London is the only place in the world for all manner
of husbands. Besides, my dear, stranger things happen every day; and as
ladies of quality are so taken with my daughters, what will not men of quality
be? <i>Entre nous</i>, I protest I like my Lady Blarney vastly: so very obliging.
However, Miss Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs has my warm heart. But
yet, when they came to talk of places in town, you saw at once how I nailed
them. Tell me, my dear, don't you think I did for my children there?"
"Ay," returned I, not knowing well what to think of the matter; "Heaven
grant they may be both the better for it this day three months!" This was
one of those observations I usually made to impress my wife with an opinion
of my sagacity; for if the girls succeeded, then it was a pious wish fulfilled;
but if anything unfortunate ensued, then it might be looked upon as a prophecy.
All this conversation, however, was only preparatory to another scheme,
and indeed I dreaded as much. This was nothing less than that, as we were
now to hold up our heads a little higher in the world, it would be proper
to sell the colt, which was grown old, at a neighbouring fair, and buy us a
horse that would carry single or double upon an occasion, and make a pretty
appearance at church or upon a visit. This at first I opposed stoutly, but it
was as stoutly defended. However, as I weakened, my antagonists gained
strength, till at last it was resolved to part with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the fair happened on the following day, I had intentions of going
<a id='Page_49'></a>myself; but my wife persuaded me that I had got a cold, and nothing could
prevail upon her to permit me from home. "No, my dear," said she, "our
son Moses is a discreet boy, and can buy and sell to very good advantage; you
know all our great bargains are of his purchasing. He always stands out and
higgles, and actually tires them till he gets a bargain."</p>

<p class='c009'>As I had some opinion of my son's prudence, I was willing enough to
entrust him with this commission; and the next morning I perceived his sisters
mighty busy in fitting out Moses for the fair; trimming his hair, brushing his
buckles, and cocking his hat with pins. The business of the toilet being over,
we had at last the satisfaction of seeing him mounted upon the colt, with a
deal box before him to bring home groceries in. He had on a coat made of
that cloth called thunder-and-lightning, which, though grown too short, was
much too good to be thrown away. His waistcoat was of gosling green, and
his sisters had tied his hair with a broad black riband. We all followed
him several paces from the door, bawling after him, "Good luck! good
luck!" till we could see him no longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was scarcely gone, when Mr. Thornhill's butler came to congratulate us
upon our good fortune, saying that he overheard his young master mention our
names with great commendation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Good fortune seemed resolved not to come alone. Another footman from
the same family followed, with a card for my daughters, importing that the two
ladies had received such pleasing accounts from Mr. Thornhill of us all, that
after a few previous inquiries they hoped to be perfectly satisfied. "Ay,"
cried my wife, "I now see it is no easy matter to get into the families of the
great, but when one once gets in, then, as Moses says, one may go to sleep."
To this piece of humour, for she intended it for wit, my daughters assented
with a loud laugh of pleasure. In short, such was her satisfaction at this
message, that she actually put her hand in her pocket, and gave the messenger
sevenpence-halfpenny.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was to be our visiting day. The next that came was Mr. Burchell,
who had been at the fair. He brought my little ones a pennyworth of gingerbread
each, which my wife undertook to keep for them, and give them by
letters at a time. He brought my daughters also a couple of boxes, in which
they might keep wafers, snuff, patches, or even money, when they got it. My
wife was usually fond of a weasel-skin purse, as being the most lucky; but
this by the bye. We had still a regard for Mr. Burchell, though his late rude
behaviour was in some measure displeasing; nor could we now avoid
communicating our happiness to him, and asking his advice: although
we seldom followed advice, we were all ready enough to ask it. When
he read the note from the two ladies he shook his head, and observed
that an affair of this sort demanded the utmost circumspection. This
air of diffidence highly displeased my wife. "I never doubted, sir,"
cried she, "your readiness to be against my daughters and me. You have
more circumspection than is wanted. However, I fancy when we come to
ask advice, we shall apply to persons who seem to have made use of it
themselves." "Whatever my conduct may have been, madam," replied he,
"is not the present question; though, as I have made no use of advice
myself, I should in conscience give it to those that will." As I was
apprehensive this answer might draw on a repartee, making up by abuse
what it wanted in wit, I changed the subject, by seeming to wonder what
could keep our son so long at the fair, as it was now almost nightfall.
"Never mind our son," cried my wife; "depend upon it he knows what he is
about; I'll warrant we'll never see him sell his hen on a rainy day. I have
seen him buy such bargains as would amaze one. I'll tell you a good story
about that, that will make you split your sides with laughing. But, as I live,
yonder comes Moses, without a horse, and the box at his back."</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_51'></a>As she spoke, Moses came slowly on foot, and sweating under the deal box,
which he had strapped round his shoulders like a pedlar. "Welcome!
welcome, Moses! Well, my boy, what have you brought us from the fair?"
"I have brought you myself," cried Moses, with a sly look, and resting the
box on the dresser. "Ay, Moses," cried my wife, "that we know, but where
is the horse?" "I have sold him," cried Moses, "for three pounds five
shillings and twopence." "Well done! my good boy," returned she; "I
knew you would touch them off. Between ourselves, three pounds five
shillings and twopence is no bad day's work. Come, let us have it then." "I
have brought back no money," cried Moses again, "I have laid it all out in a
bargain, and here it is," pulling out a bundle from his breast; "here they
are: a gross of green spectacles, with silver rims and shagreen cases." "A
gross of green spectacles!" repeated my wife, in a faint voice. "And you
have parted with the colt, and brought us back nothing but a gross of green
paltry spectacles!" "Dear mother," cried the boy, "why won't you listen to
reason? I had them a dead bargain, or I should not have bought them. The
silver rims alone will sell for double the money." "A fig for the silver rims!"
cried my wife in a passion: "I dare swear they won't sell for above half the
money at the rate of broken silver, five shillings an ounce." "You need be
under no uneasiness," cried I, "about selling the rims, for they are not worth
sixpence, for I perceive they are only copper varnished over." "What!" cried
<a id='Page_52'></a>my wife, "not silver! the rims not silver!" "No," cried I, "no more silver
than your saucepan. "And so," returned she, "we have parted with the
colt, and have only got a gross of green spectacles, with copper rims and
shagreen cases! A murrain take such trumpery! The blockhead has been
imposed upon, and should have known his company better!" "There, my
dear," cried I, "you are wrong; he should not have known them at all."
"Marry, hang the idiot!" returned she, "to bring me such stuff; if I had
them I would throw them in the fire." "There again you are wrong, my
dear," cried I, "for though they be copper, we will keep them by us, as copper
spectacles, you know, are better than nothing."</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time the unfortunate Moses was undeceived. He now saw that he
had indeed been imposed upon by a prowling sharper, who, observing his figure,
had marked him for an easy prey. I therefore asked him the circumstances of
his deception. He sold the horse, it seems, and walked the fair in search of
another. A reverend-looking man brought him to a tent, under pretence of
having one to sell. "Here," continued Moses, "we met another man, very
well dressed, who desired to borrow twenty pounds upon these, saying that he
wanted money, and would dispose of them for a third of their value. The
first gentleman, who pretended to be my friend, whispered me to buy them,
and cautioned me not to let so good an offer pass. I sent for Mr. Flamborough,
and they talked him up as finely as they did me; and so at last we
were persuaded to buy the two gross between us."</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'>Our family had now made several attempts to be fine; but some unforeseen
disaster demolished each as soon as projected. I endeavoured to take the
advantage of every disappointment to improve their good sense, in proportion
as they were frustrated in ambition. "You see, my children," cried I, "how
little is to be got by attempts to impose upon the world, in coping with our
betters. Such as are poor, and will associate with none but the rich, are hated
by those they avoid, and despised by those they follow. Unequal combinations
<a id='Page_53'></a>are always disadvantageous to the weaker side; the rich having the pleasure,
the poor the inconveniences, that result from them. But come, Dick, my boy,
repeat the fable you were reading to-day, for the good of the company."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Once upon a time," cried the child, "a giant and a dwarf were friends,
and kept together. They made a bargain that they never would forsake each
other, but go seek adventures. The first battle they fought was with two
Saracens; and the dwarf, who was very courageous, dealt one of the champions
a most angry blow. It did the Saracen but very little injury, who, lifting
up his sword, fairly struck off the poor dwarf's arm. He was now in a woful
plight; but the giant, coming to his assistance, in a short time left the two
Saracens dead on the plain, and the dwarf cut off the dead man's head out of
spite. They then travelled on to another adventure. This was against three
bloody-minded satyrs, who were carrying away a damsel in distress. The
dwarf was not quite so fierce now as before, but for all that struck the first
blow, which was returned by another that knocked out his eye; but the giant
was soon up with them, and, had they not fled, would certainly have killed
them every one. They were all very joyful for this victory, and the damsel
who was relieved fell in love with the giant, and married him. They now
travelled far, and farther than I can tell, till they met with a company of
robbers. The giant, for the first time, was foremost now; but the dwarf was
not far behind. The battle was stout and long. Wherever the giant came
all fell before him; but the dwarf had like to have been killed more than once.
At last the victory declared for the two adventurers; but the dwarf lost his
leg. The dwarf had now lost an arm, a leg, and an eye, while the giant was
without a single wound. Upon which he cried out to his little companion,
'My little hero, this is glorious sport; let us get one victory more, and then
we shall have honour for ever.' 'No,' cries the dwarf, who by this time
was grown wiser, 'no; I declare off; I'll fight no more, for I find, in every
battle, that you get all the honour and rewards, but all the blows fall
upon me.'"</p>

<p class='c009'>I was going to moralise upon this fable, when our attention was called off
to a warm dispute between my wife and Mr. Burchell, upon my daughters'
intended expedition to town. My wife very strenuously insisted upon the
advantages that would result from it. Mr. Burchell, on the contrary, dissuaded
her with great ardour, and I stood neuter. His present dissuasions
seemed but the second part of those which were received with so ill a grace
in the morning. The dispute grew high, while poor Deborah, instead of
<a id='Page_54'></a>reasoning stronger, talked louder, and was at last obliged to take shelter from
a defeat in clamour. The conclusion of her harangue, however, was highly
displeasing to us all: she knew, she said, of some who had their secret reasons
for what they advised; but for her part, she wished such to stay away from
her house for the future.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'> "Madam," cried Burchell, with looks of great
composure, which tended to inflame her the more, "as for secret reasons, you
are right; I have secret reasons which I forbear to mention, because you are
not able to answer those of which I make no secret. But I find my visits
here are become troublesome; I'll take my leave therefore now, and perhaps
<a id='Page_55'></a>come once more to take a final farewell when I am quitting the country."
Thus saying, he took up his hat; nor could the attempts of Sophia, whose
looks seemed to upbraid his precipitancy, prevent his going.</p>

<p class='c009'>When gone, we all regarded each other for some minutes with confusion.
My wife, who knew herself to be the cause, strove to hide her concern with a
forced smile and an air of assurance, which I was willing to reprove. "How,
woman!" cried I to her, "is it thus we treat strangers? Is it thus we return
their kindness? Be assured, my dear, that these were the harshest words,
and to me the most unpleasing, that ever escaped your lips!" "Why would
he provoke me then?" replied she; "but I know the motives of his advice
perfectly well. He would prevent my girls going to town, that he may have
the pleasure of my youngest daughter's company here at home. But whatever
happens, she shall choose better company than such low-lived fellows as he."
"Low-lived, my dear, do you call him?" cried I; "it is very possible we may
mistake this man's character; for he seems, upon some occasions, the most
finished gentleman I ever knew. Tell me, Sophia, my girl, has he ever given
you any secret instances of his attachment?" "His conversation with me,
sir," replied my daughter, "has ever been sensible, modest, and pleasing. As
to aught else, no; never. Once indeed I remember to have heard him say,
he never knew a woman who could find merit in a man that seemed poor."
"Such, my dear," cried I, "is the common cant of all the unfortunate or idle.
But I hope you have been taught to judge properly of such men, and that it
would be even madness to expect happiness from one who has been so very bad
an economist of his own. Your mother and I have now better prospects for
you. The next winter, which you will probably spend in town, will give you
opportunities of making a more prudent choice."</p>

<p class='c009'>What Sophia's reflections were upon this occasion I cannot pretend to
determine; but I was not displeased at the bottom that we were rid of a
guest from whom I had much to fear. Our breach of hospitality went to my
conscience a little; but I quickly silenced that monitor by two or three
specious reasons, which served to satisfy and reconcile me to myself. The pain
which conscience gives the man who has already done wrong is soon got over.
Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent,
it seldom has justice enough to accuse.</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'>The journey of my daughters to town was now resolved upon, Mr. Thornhill
having kindly promised to inspect their conduct himself, and inform us by
letter of their behaviour. But it was thought indispensably necessary that
their appearance should equal the greatness of their expectations, which could
not be done without expense. We debated, therefore, in full council, what
were the easiest methods of raising money; or, more properly speaking, what
we could most conveniently sell. The deliberation was soon finished. It was
found that our remaining horse was utterly useless for the plough without his
companion, and equally unfit for the road, as wanting an eye: it was therefore
determined that we should dispose of him, for the purpose above mentioned,
at the neighbouring fair; and, to prevent imposition, that I should go with
him myself. Though this was one of the first mercantile transactions of my
life, yet I had no doubt of acquitting myself with reputation. The opinion a
man forms of his own prudence is measured by that of the company he keeps,
and as mine was mostly in the family way, I had conceived no unfavourable
sentiments of my worldly wisdom. My wife, however, next morning at
parting, after I had got some paces from the door, called me back, to advise
me, in a whisper, to have all my eyes about me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had, in the usual forms, when I came to the fair, put my horse through
all his paces, but for some time had no bidders. At last a chapman approached,
and, after he had for a good while examined the horse round, finding him blind
of one eye, he would have nothing to say to him; a second came up, but observing
he had a spavin, declared he would not have him for the driving home;
a third perceived he had a windgall, and would bid no money; a fourth knew
by his eye that he had the bots; a fifth wondered what the plague I could do
at the fair with a blind, spavined, galled hack, that was only fit to be cut up
for a dog-kennel. By this time I began to have a most hearty contempt for
the poor animal myself, and was almost ashamed at the approach of every
customer; for though I did not entirely believe all the fellows told me, yet I
reflected that the number of witnesses was a strong presumption that they
<a id='Page_57'></a>were right; and St. Gregory, upon good works, professes himself to be of the
same opinion.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was in this mortifying situation, when a brother clergyman, an old
acquaintance, who had also business at the fair, came up, and shaking me by
the hand, proposed adjourning to a public-house, and taking a glass of whatever
we could get. I readily closed with the offer, and entering an alehouse,
we were shown into a little back room, where there was only a venerable old
man, who sat wholly intent over a very large book which he was reading. I
never in my life saw a figure that prepossessed me more favourably. His locks
of silver grey venerably shaded his temples, and his green old age seemed to
be the result of health and benevolence. However, his presence did not interrupt
our conversation: my friend and I discoursed on the various turns of
fortune we had met; the Whistonian controversy, my last pamphlet, the archdeacon's
reply, and the hard measure that was dealt me. But our attention was
in a short time taken off by the appearance of a youth, who, entering the room,
respectfully said something softly to the old stranger. "Make no apologies,
my child," said the old man: "to do good is a duty we owe to all our fellow-creatures:
take this. I wish it were more; but five pounds will relieve your
distress, and you are welcome." The modest youth shed tears of gratitude,
and yet his gratitude was scarcely equal to mine. I could have hugged the
good old man in my arms, his benevolence pleased me so. He continued to
read, and we resumed our conversation, until my companion, after some time,
recollecting that he had business to transact in the fair, promised to be soon
back; adding that he always desired to have as much of Dr. Primrose's
company as possible. The old gentleman, hearing my name mentioned,
seemed to look at me with attention for some time, and when my friend was
gone, most respectfully demanded if I was any way related to the great
Primrose, that courageous monogamist, who had been the bulwark of the
Church. Never did my heart feel sincerer rapture than at that moment.
"Sir," cried I, "the applause of so good a man as I am sure you are adds
to that happiness in my breast which your benevolence has already excited.
You behold before you, sir, that Dr. Primrose, the monogamist, whom you
have been pleased to call great. You here see that unfortunate divine, who
has so long, and it would ill become me to say successfully, fought against the
deuterogamy of the age." "Sir," cried the stranger, struck with awe, "I fear
I have been too familiar; but you'll forgive my curiosity, sir; I beg pardon."</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_59'></a>"Sir," cried I, grasping his hand, "you are so far from displeasing me by
your familiarity, that I must beg you'll accept my friendship, as you already
have my esteem." "Then with gratitude I accept the offer," cried he, squeezing
me by the hand, "thou glorious pillar of unshaken orthodoxy. And do I
behold—" I here interrupted what he was going to say; for though, as an
author, I could digest no small share of flattery, yet now my modesty would
permit no more. However, no lovers in romance ever cemented a more
instantaneous friendship. We talked upon several subjects. At first I thought
him rather devout than learned, and began to think he despised all human
doctrines as dross. Yet this no way lessened him in my esteem; for I had for
some time begun privately to harbour such an opinion myself. I therefore
took occasion to observe, that the world in general began to be blamably indifferent
as to doctrinal matters, and followed human speculations too much.
"Ay, sir," replied he, as if he had reserved all his learning to that moment,
"ay, sir, the world is in its dotage; and yet the cosmogony or creation of the
world has puzzled philosophers of all ages. What a medley of opinions have
they not broached upon the creation of the world! Sanchoniathon, Manetho,
Berosus, and Ocellus Lucanus, have all attempted it in vain. The latter has
these words, <i>Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan</i>, which imply that all things
have neither beginning nor end. Manetho also, who lived about the time of
Nebuchadon-Asser,—Asser being a Syriac word usually applied as a surname
to the kings of that country, as Teglet Phael-Asser; Nabon-Asser,—he, I
say, formed a conjecture equally absurd; for as we usually say, <i>ek to biblion
kubernetes</i>, which implies that books will never teach the world, so he
attempted to investigate——But, sir, I ask pardon, I am straying from the
question."</p>

<p class='c009'>That he actually was; nor could I for my life see how the creation
of the world had anything to do with the business I was talking of; but it
was sufficient to show me that he was a man of letters, and I now reverenced
him the more. I was resolved therefore to bring him to the touchstone; but
he was too gentle to contend for victory. Whenever I made any observation
that looked like a challenge to controversy, he would smile, shake his head, and
say nothing; by which I understood he could say much if he thought proper.
The subject, therefore, insensibly changed from the business of antiquity to
that which brought us both to the fair: mine, I told him, was to sell a horse;
and, very luckily indeed, his was to buy one for one of his tenants. My horse
was soon produced, and in fine we struck a bargain. Nothing now remained
but to pay me, and he accordingly pulled out a thirty-pound note, and bade
me change it. Not being in a capacity of complying with his demand, he
ordered his footman to be called up, who made his appearance in a very genteel
livery. "Here, Abraham," cried he, "go and get gold for this; you'll do it
<a id='Page_60'></a>at neighbour Jackson's, or anywhere." While the fellow was gone, he entertained
me with a pathetic harangue on the great scarcity of silver, which I
undertook to improve by deploring also the great scarcity of gold; so that, by
the time Abraham returned, we had both agreed that money was never so hard
to be come at as now. Abraham returned to inform us, that he had been over
the whole fair and could not get change, though he had offered half-a-crown
for doing it. This was a very great disappointment to us all; but the old
gentlemen having paused a little, asked me if I knew one Solomon Flamborough
in my part of the country; upon replying that he was my next-door
neighbour, "If that be the case then," returned he, "I believe we shall deal.
You shall have a draft upon him, payable at sight; and let me tell you, he is
as warm a man as any within five miles round him. Honest Solomon and I
have been acquainted for many years together. I remember I always beat him
at three jumps; but he could hop upon one leg further than I." A draft upon
my neighbour was to me the same as money; I was sufficiently convinced of
his ability. The draft was signed and put into my hands, and Mr. Jenkinson,
the old gentleman, his man Abraham, and my horse, old Blackberry, trotted
off very well pleased with each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a short interval, being left to reflection, I began to recollect that I
had done wrong in taking a draft from a stranger, and so prudently resolved
upon following the purchaser, and having back my horse. But this was now
too late; I therefore made directly homewards, resolving to get the draft
changed into money at my friend's as fast as possible. I found my honest
neighbour smoking his pipe at his own door; and informing him that I had
a small bill upon him, he read it twice over. "You can read the name, I suppose,"
cried I—"Ephraim Jenkinson." "Yes," returned he, "the name is
written plain enough, and I know the gentleman too, the greatest rascal under
the canopy of heaven. This is the very same rogue who sold us the spectacles.
Was he not a venerable-looking man, with grey hair, and no flaps to his
pocket-holes? and did he not talk a long string of learning about Greek,
cosmogony, and the world?" To this I replied with a groan. "Ay," continued
he, "he has but that one piece of learning in the world, and he always talks
it away whenever he finds a scholar in company: but I know the rogue, and
will catch him yet."</p>

<p class='c009'>Though I was already sufficiently mortified, my greatest struggle was to
come, in facing my wife and daughters. No truant was ever more afraid of
returning to school, there to behold the master's visage, than I was of going
<a id='Page_61'></a>home. I was determined, however, to anticipate their fury, by first falling
into a passion myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, alas! upon entering, I found the family no way disposed for battle.
My wife and girls were all in tears, Mr. Thornhill having been there that
day to inform them that their journey to town was entirely over. The two
ladies, having heard reports of us from some malicious person about us, were
that day set out for London. He could neither discover the tendency nor the
author of these; but, whatever they might be, or whoever might have broached
them, he continued to assure our family of his friendship and protection. I
found, therefore, that they bore my disappointment with great resignation, as
it was eclipsed in the greatness of their own. But what perplexed us most,
was to think who could be so base as to asperse the character of a family so
harmless as ours—too humble to excite envy, and too inoffensive to create
disgust.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XV.</i><br /> <br /><i>All Mr. Burchell's villany at once detected.—<br />The folly of being over-wise.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>That evening, and part of the following day, was employed in fruitless
attempts to discover our enemies: scarcely a family in the neighbourhood
but incurred our suspicions, and each of us had reasons for our opinion best
known to ourselves. As we were in this perplexity, one of our little boys,
who had been playing abroad, brought in a letter-case which he found on the
green. It was quickly known to belong to Mr. Burchell, with whom it had
been seen; and, upon examination, contained some hints upon different
subjects; but what particularly engaged our attention was a sealed note,
superscribed, "The copy of a letter to be sent to the two ladies at Thornhill
Castle." It instantly occurred that he was the base informer: and we
deliberated whether the note should not be broken open. I was against it;
but Sophia, who said she was sure that of all men he would be the last to be
guilty of so much baseness, insisted upon its being read. In this she was
seconded by the rest of the family; and at their joint solicitation, I read as
follows:—</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'>"<span class='sc'>Ladies</span>,</p>

<p class='c009'>  "The bearer will sufficiently satisfy you as to the person from whom this
comes: one at least the friend of innocence, and ready to prevent its being
seduced. I am informed for a truth, that you have some intention of bringing
two young ladies to town, whom I have some knowledge of, under the character
of companions. As I would neither have simplicity imposed upon nor virtue
contaminated, I must offer it as my opinion that the impropriety of such a
step will be attended with dangerous consequences. It has never been my
way to treat the infamous or the lewd with severity; nor should I now have
taken this method of explaining myself, or reproving folly, did it not aim at
<a id='Page_63'></a>guilt. Take, therefore, the admonition of a friend, and seriously reflect on the
consequences of introducing infamy and vice into retreats where peace and
innocence have hitherto resided."</p>

<p class='c009'>Our doubts were now at an end. There seemed indeed something
applicable to both sides in this letter, and its censures might as well be
referred to those to whom it was written as to us; but the malicious meaning
was obvious, and we went no farther. My wife had scarcely patience to hear
me to the end, but railed at the writer with unrestrained resentment. Olivia
was equally severe, and Sophia seemed perfectly amazed at his baseness. As
for my part, it appeared to me one of the vilest instances of unprovoked
ingratitude I had ever met with. Nor could I account for it in any other
manner than by imputing it to his desire of detaining my youngest daughter
in the country, to have the more frequent opportunities of an interview. In
this manner we all sat ruminating upon schemes of vengeance, when our
other little boy came running in to tell us that Mr. Burchell was approaching
at the other end of the field. It is easier to conceive than describe the complicated
sensations which are felt from the pain of a recent injury, and the
pleasure of approaching vengeance. Though our intentions were only to
upbraid him with his ingratitude, yet it was resolved to do it in a manner
that would be perfectly cutting. For this purpose we agreed to meet him
with our usual smiles, to chat in the beginning with more than ordinary
kindness, to amuse him a little; and then, in the midst of the flattering calms
to burst upon him like an earthquake, and overwhelm him with the sense of
his own baseness. This being resolved upon, my wife undertook to manage
the business herself, as she really had some talents for such an undertaking.
We saw him approach; he entered, drew a chair, and sat down. "A fine
day, Mr. Burchell." "A very fine day, doctor; though I fancy we shall have
some rain, by the shooting of my corns." "The shooting of your horns!"
cried my wife, in a loud fit of laughter, and then asked pardon for being fond
of a joke. "Dear madam," replied he, "I pardon you with all my heart; for
I protest I should not have thought it a joke had you not told me." "Perhaps
not, sir," cried my wife, winking at us: "and yet I dare say you can tell us
how many jokes go to an ounce." "I fancy, madam," returned Burchell,
"you have been reading a jest-book this morning, that ounce of jokes is so
very good a conceit; and yet, madam, I had rather see half an ounce of
understanding." "I believe you might," cried my wife, still smiling at us,
<a id='Page_64'></a>though the laugh was against her; "and yet I have seen some men pretend
to understanding that have very little." "And no doubt," replied her
antagonist, "you have known ladies set up for wit that had none." I quickly
began to find that my wife was likely to gain but little at this business; so I
resolved to treat him in a style of more severity myself. "Both wit and
understanding," cried I, "are trifles without integrity; it is that which gives
value to every character. The ignorant peasant without fault, is greater than
the philosopher with many; for what is genius or courage without a heart?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>'An honest man's the noblest work of God.'"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>"I always held that hackneyed maxim of Pope's," returned Mr. Burchell,
"as very unworthy of a man of genius, and a base desertion of his own
superiority. As the reputation of books is raised, not by their freedom from
defect, but the greatness of their beauties; so should that of men be prized,
not for their exemption from fault, but the size of those virtues they are
possessed of. The scholar may want prudence; the statesman may have pride,
and the champion ferocity; but shall we prefer to these the low mechanic, who
laboriously plods on through life without censure or applause? We might as
well prefer the tame, correct paintings of the Flemish school to the erroneous,
but sublime animations of the Roman pencil."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Sir," replied I, "your present observation is just, when there are shining
virtues and minute defects; but when it appears that great vices are opposed
in the same mind to as extraordinary virtues, such a character deserves
contempt."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Perhaps," cried he, "there may be some such monsters as you describe,
of great vices joined to great virtues; yet, in my progress through life, I
never yet found one instance of their existence; on the contrary, I have ever
perceived that where the mind was capacious the affections were good. And
indeed Providence seems kindly our friend in this particular, thus to debilitate
the understanding where the heart is corrupt, and diminish the power where
there is the will to do mischief. This rule seems to extend even to other
animals: the little vermin race are ever treacherous, cruel, and cowardly;
whilst those endowed with strength and power are generous, brave, and
gentle."</p>

<p class='c009'>"These observations sound well," returned I, "and yet it would be easy
this moment to point out a man," and I fixed my eye steadfastly upon him,
"whose head and heart form a most detestable contrast. Ay, sir," continued
<a id='Page_65'></a>I, raising my voice, "and I am glad to have this opportunity of detecting him
in the midst of his fancied security. Do you know this, sir—this pocket-book?"
"Yes, sir," returned he, with a face of impenetrable assurance;
"that pocket-book is mine, and I am glad you have found it." "And do you
know," cried I, "this letter? Nay, never falter, man; but look me full in the
face. I say, do you know this letter?" "That letter?" replied he; "yes, it
was I that wrote that letter." "And how could you," said I, "so basely, so
ungratefully, presume to write this letter?" "And how came you," replied
he, with looks of unparalleled effrontery, "so basely to presume to break open
this letter? Don't you know, now, I could hang you all for this? All that I
have to do is to swear at the next justice's that you have been guilty of
breaking open the lock of my pocket-book, and so hang you all up at this
door." This piece of unexpected insolence raised me to such a pitch, that I
could scarcely govern my passion. "Ungrateful wretch! begone, and no
longer pollute my dwelling with thy baseness. Begone! and never let me see
thee again: go from my door! and the only punishment I wish thee is an
alarmed conscience, which will be a sufficient tormentor!" So saying, I
threw him his pocket-book, which he took up with a smile, and shutting the
clasps with the utmost composure, left us quite astonished at the serenity of
his assurance. My wife was particularly enraged that nothing could make
him angry, or make him seem ashamed of his villanies. "My dear," cried I,
willing to calm those passions that had been raised too high among us, "we
are not to be surprised that bad men want shame; they only blush at being
detected in doing good, but glory in their vices.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Guilt and Shame (says the allegory) were at first companions, and in the
beginning of their journey inseparably kept together. But their union was
soon found to be disagreeable and inconvenient to both: Guilt gave Shame
frequent uneasiness, and Shame often betrayed the secret conspiracies of Guilt.
After long disagreement, therefore, they at length consented to part for ever.
Guilt boldly walked forward alone, to overtake Fate, that went before in the
shape of an executioner; but Shame, being naturally timorous, returned back
to keep company with Virtue, which in the beginning of their journey they
had left behind. Thus, my children, after men have travelled through a few
stages in vice, shame forsakes them, and returns back to wait upon the few
virtues they have still remaining."</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'>Whatever might have been Sophia's sensations, the rest of the family were
easily consoled for Mr. Burchell's absence by the company of our landlord,
<a id='Page_67'></a>whose visits now became more frequent and longer. Though he had been
disappointed in procuring my daughters the amusements of the town, as he
designed, he took every opportunity of supplying them with those little recreations
which our retirement would admit of. He usually came in the morning,
and while my son and I followed our occupations abroad, he sat with the
family at home, and amused them by describing the town, with every part of
which he was particularly acquainted. He could repeat all the observations
that were retailed in the atmosphere of the play-houses, and had all the good
things of the high wits by rote, long before they made their way into the jest-books.
The intervals between conversation were employed in teaching my
daughters piquet; or, sometimes, in setting my two little ones to box, to make
them <i>sharp</i>, as he called it: but the hopes of having him for a son-in-law in
some measure blinded us to all his imperfections. It must be owned, that
my wife laid a thousand schemes to entrap him; or, to speak it more tenderly,
used every art to magnify the merit of her daughter. If the cakes at tea ate
short and crisp, they were made by Olivia; if the gooseberry-wine was well
knit, the gooseberries were of her gathering: it was her fingers which gave the
pickles their peculiar green; and in the composition of a pudding it was her
judgment that mixed the ingredients. Then the poor woman would sometimes
tell the squire, that she thought him and Olivia extremely of a size, and
would bid both stand up to see which was the tallest. These instances of
cunning, which she thought impenetrable, yet which everybody saw through,
were very pleasing to our benefactor, who gave every day some new proofs of
his passion, which, though they had not arisen to proposals of marriage, yet,
we thought, fell but little short of it; and his slowness was sometimes
attributed to native bashfulness, and sometimes to his fear of offending his
uncle. An occurrence, however, which happened soon after, put it beyond a
doubt that he designed to become one of our family; my wife even regarded
it as an absolute promise.</p>

<p class='c009'>My wife and daughters, happening to return a visit at neighbour Flamborough's,
found that family had lately got their pictures drawn by a limner
who travelled the country, and took likenesses for fifteen shillings a head. As
this family and ours had long a sort of rivalry in point of taste, our spirit took
the alarm at this stolen march upon us, and, notwithstanding all I could say,
and I said much, it was resolved that we should have our pictures done too.
Having, therefore, engaged the limner (for what could I do?), our next deliberation
was to show the superiority of our taste in the attitudes. As for our
<a id='Page_68'></a>neighbour's family, there were seven of them, and they were drawn with seven
oranges: a thing quite out of taste—no variety in life—no composition in the
world. We desired to have something in a brighter style, and, after many
debates, at length came to an unanimous resolution of being drawn together
in one large historical family-piece. This would be cheaper, since one frame
would serve for all, and it would be infinitely more genteel; for all families of
any taste were now drawn in the same manner. As we did not immediately
recollect an historical subject to hit us, we were contented each with being
drawn as independent historical figures. My wife desired to be represented
as Venus, and the painter was requested not to be too frugal of his diamonds
in her stomacher and hair. Her two little ones were to be as Cupids by her
side; while I, in my gown and band, was to present her with my books on the
Whistonian controversy. Olivia would be drawn as an Amazon, sitting upon
a bank of flowers, dressed in a green joseph, richly laced with gold, and a
whip in her hand. Sophia was to be a shepherdess, with as many sheep as
the painter could put in for nothing; and Moses was to be dressed out with
a hat and white feather.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our taste so much pleased the squire that he insisted on being put in as
one of the family, in the character of Alexander the Great, at Olivia's feet.
This was considered by us all as an indication of his desire to be introduced
into the family; nor could we refuse his request. The painter was therefore
set to work, and, as he wrought with assiduity and expedition, in less than
four days the whole was completed. The piece was large, and it must be
owned he did not spare his colours; for which my wife gave him great
encomiums. We were all perfectly satisfied with his performance; but an
unfortunate circumstance, which had not occurred till the picture was
finished, now struck us with dismay. It was so very large that we had no
place in the house to fix it. How we all came to disregard so material a point
is inconceivable; but certain it is, we had all been greatly remiss. This
picture, therefore, instead of gratifying our vanity, as we hoped, leaned in a
most mortifying manner against the kitchen wall, where the canvas was
stretched and painted, much too large to be got through any of the doors, and
the jest of all our neighbours. One compared it to Robinson Crusoe's longboat,
too large to be removed; another thought it more resembled a reel in a
bottle; some wondered how it could be got out, but still more were amazed
how it ever got in.</p>

<p class='c009'>But though it excited the ridicule of some, it effectually raised more
<a id='Page_69'></a>malicious suggestions in many. The squire's portrait being found united with
ours was an honour too great to escape envy. Scandalous whispers began to
circulate at our expense, and our tranquillity was continually disturbed by
persons who came as friends to tell us what was said of us by enemies.
These reports were always resented with becoming spirit; but scandal ever
improves by opposition.</p>

<p class='c009'>We once again, therefore, entered into consultation upon obviating the
malice of our enemies, and at last came to a resolution which had too much
cunning to give me entire satisfaction. It was this: as our principal object
was to discover the honour of Mr. Thornhill's addresses, my wife undertook to
sound him, by pretending to ask his advice in the choice of a husband for her
eldest daughter. If this was not found sufficient to induce him to a declaration,
it was then resolved to terrify him with a rival. To this last step,
however, I would by no means give my consent, till Olivia gave me the most
solemn assurances that she would marry the person provided to rival him
upon this occasion, if he did not prevent it by taking her himself. Such was
the scheme laid, which, though I did not strenuously oppose, I did not
entirely approve.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next time, therefore, that Mr. Thornhill came to see us, my girls took
care to be out of the way, in order to give their mamma an opportunity of
putting her scheme in execution; but they only retired to the next room,
from whence they could overhear the whole conversation. My wife artfully
introduced it by observing, that one of the Miss Flamboroughs was like to
have a very good match of it in Mr. Spanker. To this the squire assenting,
she proceeded to remark, that they who had warm fortunes were always sure
of getting good husbands: "But heaven help," continued she, "the girls that
have none! What signifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill? or what signifies all the
virtue and all the qualifications in the world, in this age of self-interest? It is
not, What is she? but, What has she? is all the cry."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Madam," returned he, "I highly approve the justice, as well as the
novelty, of your remarks; and if I were a king it should be otherwise. It
should then, indeed, be fine times for the girls without fortunes: our two
young ladies should be the first for whom I would provide."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Ah! sir," returned my wife, "you are pleased to be facetious: but I
wish I were a queen, and then I know where my eldest daughter should look
for a husband. But now that you have put it into my head, seriously, Mr.
Thornhill, can't you recommend me a proper husband for her? she is now
<a id='Page_70'></a>nineteen years old, well grown, and well educated; and, in my humble
opinion, does not want for parts."</p>

<div  class='figcenter id020'>

<p> <i>"Madam," returned he, "I highly approve the justice,<br />as well as the novelty, of your remarks; and if I were a<br />king it should be otherwise."</i>—<i>p.</i> 68.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>"Madam," replied he, "if I were to choose, I would find out a person
possessed of every accomplishment that can make an angel happy; one with
prudence, fortune, taste, and sincerity: such, madam, would be, in my opinion,
the proper husband." "Ay, sir," said she, "but do you know of any such
person?" "No, madam," returned he, "it is impossible to know any person
that deserves to be her husband: she's too great a treasure for one man's
possession: she's a goddess. Upon my soul, I speak what I think: she is an
<a id='Page_71'></a>angel." "Ah, Mr. Thornhill, you only flatter my poor girl: but we have been
thinking of marrying her to one of your tenants, whose mother is lately dead,
and who wants a manager; you know whom I mean—Farmer Williams; a
warm man, Mr. Thornhill, able to give her good bread; and who has several
times made her proposals" (which was actually the case). "But, sir," concluded
she, "I should be glad to have your approbation of our choice."
"How, madam!" replied he, "my approbation! My approbation of such a
choice! Never. What! sacrifice so much beauty, and sense, and goodness,
to a creature insensible of the blessing! Excuse me, I can never approve of
such a piece of injustice! And I have my reasons." "Indeed, sir," cried
Deborah, "if you have your reasons, that's another affair; but I should be
glad to know those reasons." "Excuse me, madam," returned he, "they lie
too deep for discovery," (laying his hand upon his bosom,) "they remain
buried, riveted here."</p>

<p class='c009'>After he was gone, upon a general consultation, we could not tell what to
make of these fine sentiments. Olivia considered them as instances of the
most exalted passion; but I was not quite so sanguine: it seemed to me
pretty plain that they had more of love than matrimony in them; yet,
whatever they might portend, it was resolved to prosecute the scheme of
Farmer Williams, who, from my daughter's first appearance in the country,
had paid her his addresses.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XVII.</i><br /> <br /><i>Scarcely any virtue found to resist the power of long<br />and pleasing temptation.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>As I only studied my child's real happiness, the assiduity of Mr. Williams
pleased me, as he was in easy circumstances, prudent and sincere. It required
but very little encouragement to revive his former passion; so that in an
evening or two he and Mr. Thornhill met at our house, and surveyed each other
for some time with looks of anger; but Williams owed his landlord no rent,
and little regarded his indignation. Olivia, on her side, acted the coquette to
perfection, if that might be called acting which was her real character, pretending
to lavish all her tenderness on her new lover. Mr. Thornhill appeared
quite dejected at this preference, and with a pensive air took leave; though I
own it puzzled me to find him in so much pain as he appeared to be, when he
<a id='Page_72'></a>had it in his power so easily to remove the cause, by declaring an honourable
passion. But whatever uneasiness he seemed to endure, it could easily be
perceived that Olivia's anguish was much greater. After any of these interviews
between her lovers, of which there were several, she usually retired to
solitude, and there indulged her grief. It was in such a situation I found her
one evening, after she had been for some time supporting a fictitious gaiety.
"You now see, my child," said I, "that your confidence in Mr. Thornhill's
passion was all a dream: he permits the rivalry of another, every way his
inferior, though he knows it lies in his power to secure you to himself by a
candid declaration." "Yes, papa," returned she, "but he has his reasons for
this delay; I know he has. The sincerity of his looks and words convinces
me of his real esteem. A short time, I hope, will discover the generosity of
his sentiments, and convince you that my opinion of him has been more just
than yours." "Olivia, my darling," returned I, "every scheme that has been
hitherto pursued to compel him to a declaration has been proposed and
planned by yourself, nor can you in the least say that I have constrained you.
But you must not suppose, my dear, that I will ever be instrumental in suffering
his honest rival to be the dupe of your ill-placed passion. Whatever time
you require to bring your fancied admirer to an explanation shall be granted;
but at the expiration of that term, if he is still regardless, I must absolutely
insist that honest Mr. Williams shall be rewarded for his fidelity. The
character which I have hitherto supported in life demands this from me;
and my tenderness as a parent shall never influence my integrity as a man.
Name, then, your day: let it be as distant as you think proper, and in the
meantime take care to let Mr. Thornhill know the exact time on which I
design delivering you up to another. If he really loves you, his own good
sense will readily suggest that there is but one method alone to prevent his
losing you for ever." This proposal, which she could not avoid considering as
perfectly just, was readily agreed to. She again renewed her most positive
promise of marrying Mr. Williams in case of the other's insensibility; and at
the next opportunity, in Mr. Thornhill's presence, that day month was fixed
upon for her nuptials with his rival.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such vigorous proceedings seemed to redouble Mr. Thornhill's anxiety:
but what Olivia really felt gave me some uneasiness. In this struggle between
prudence and passion, her vivacity quite forsook her, and every opportunity of
solitude was sought, and spent in tears. One week passed away; but Mr.
Thornhill made no efforts to restrain her nuptials. The succeeding week he
<a id='Page_73'></a>was still assiduous, but not more open. On the third he discontinued his visits
entirely; and instead of my daughter testifying any impatience, as I expected,
she seemed to retain a pensive tranquillity, which I looked upon as resignation.
For my own part, I was now sincerely pleased with thinking that my child
was going to be secured in a continuance of competence and peace, and
frequently applauded her resolution in preferring happiness to ostentation.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was within about four days of her intended nuptials, that my little
family at night were gathered round a charming fire, telling stories of the past,
and laying schemes for the future; busied in forming a thousand projects, and
laughing at whatever folly came uppermost. "Well, Moses," cried I, "we
shall soon, my boy, have a wedding in the family; what is your opinion of
matters and things in general?" "My opinion, father, is, that all things go on
very well; and I was just now thinking, that when sister Livy is married to
Farmer Williams, we shall then have the loan of the cider-press and brewing-tubs
for nothing." "That we shall, Moses," cried I, "and he will sing us <i>Death
and the Lady</i>, to raise our spirits, into the bargain." "He has taught that song
to our Dick," cried Moses; "and I think he goes through it very prettily."
"Does he so?" cried I, "then let us have it: where is little Dick? let him up
with it boldly." "My brother Dick," cried Bill, my youngest, "is just gone
out with his sister Livy; but Mr. Williams has taught me two songs, and I'll
sing them for you, papa. Which song do you choose—<i>The Dying Swan</i>, or
the <i>Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog</i>?" "The elegy, child, by all means,"
said I; "I never heard that yet. And Deborah, my life, grief, you know, is
dry; let us have a bottle of the best gooseberry-wine, to keep up our spirits.
I have wept so much at all sorts of elegies of late, that, without an enlivening
glass, I am sure this will overcome me. And Sophy, love, take your guitar,
and thrum in with the boy a little."</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>"A very good boy, Bill, upon my word; and an elegy that may be
truly called tragical. Come, my children, here's Bill's health, and may he
one day be a bishop!"</p>

<p class='c009'>"With all my heart," cried my wife; "and if he but preaches as well as
he sings, I make no doubt of him. The most of his family, by the mother's
<a id='Page_75'></a>side, could sing a good song. It was a common saying in our country, that
the family of the Blenkinsops could never look straight before them; nor the
Hugginsons blow out a candle; and there were none of the Grograms but
could sing a song, or of the Marjorams but could tell a story." "However
that be," cried I, "the most vulgar ballad of all generally pleases me better
than the fine modern odes, and things that petrify us in a single stanza: productions
that we at once detest and praise. Put the glass to your brother,
Moses. The great fault of these elegiasts is, that they are in despair for griefs
that give the sensible part of mankind very little pain. A lady loses her muff,
her fan, or her lap-dog; and so the silly poet runs home to versify the disaster."</p>

<p class='c009'>"That may be the mode," cried Moses, "in sublimer compositions; but
the Ranelagh songs that come down to us are perfectly familiar, and all cast
in the same mould: Colin meets Dolly, and they hold a dialogue together; he
gives her a fairing to put in her hair, and she presents him with a nosegay;
and then they go together to church, where they give good advice to young
nymphs and swains to get married as fast as they can."</p>

<p class='c009'>"And very good advice too," cried I; "and I am told there is not a place
in the world where advice can be given with so much propriety as there: for,
as it persuades us to marry, it also furnishes us with a wife; and surely that
must be an excellent market, my boy, where we are told what we want, and
supplied with it when wanting."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Yes, sir," returned Moses, "and I know but of two such markets for
wives in Europe, Ranelagh in England, and Fontarabia in Spain. The Spanish
market is open once a year, but our English wives are saleable every night."</p>

<p class='c009'>"You are right, my boy," cried his mother; "Old England is the only place
in the world for husbands to get wives." "And for wives to manage their
husbands," interrupted I. "It is a proverb abroad, that if a bridge were
built across the sea, all the ladies of the continent would come over to take
pattern from ours; for there are no such wives in Europe as our own. But
let us have one bottle more, Deborah, my life, and, Moses, give us a good
song. What thanks do we not owe to Heaven for thus bestowing tranquillity,
health, and competence! I think myself happier now than the greatest
monarch upon earth. He has no such fireside, nor such pleasant faces about
it. Yes, Deborah, we are now growing old; but the evening of our life is
likely to be happy. We are descended from ancestors that knew no stain, and
we shall leave a good and virtuous race of children behind us. While we live
they will be our support and our pleasure here, and when we die they will
<a id='Page_76'></a>transmit our honour untainted to posterity. Come, my son, we wait for a
song; let us have a chorus. But where is my darling Olivia? That little
cherub's voice is always sweetest in the concert." Just as I spoke, Dick
came running in. "O papa, papa, she is gone from us! she is gone from
us; my sister Livy is gone from us for ever!" "Gone, child!" "Yes; she
is gone off with two gentlemen in a post-chaise, and one of them kissed her,
and said he would die for her; and she cried very much, and was for coming
back; but he persuaded her again, and she went into the chaise, and said, 'Oh!
what will my poor papa do when he knows I am undone!'" "Now, then," cried
I, "my children, go and be miserable; for we shall never enjoy one hour more.
And Oh, may Heaven's everlasting fury light upon him and his! Thus to rob
me of my child! And sure it will—for taking back my sweet innocent that I
was leading up to heaven! Such sincerity as my child was possessed of! But
all our earthly happiness is now over! Go, my children, go and be miserable
and infamous—for my heart is broken within me!" "Father," cried my son,
"is this your fortitude?" "Fortitude, child! Yes, he shall see I have fortitude.
Bring me my pistols—I'll pursue the traitor—while he is on earth, I'll
pursue him! Old as I am, he shall find I can sting him yet—the villain—the
perfidious villain!" I had by this time reached down my pistols, when
my poor wife, whose passions were not so strong as mine, caught me in
her arms. "My dearest, dearest husband," cried she, "the Bible is the only
weapon that is fit for your old hands now. Open that, my love, and read our
anguish into patience, for she has vilely deceived us." "Indeed, sir," resumed
my son, after a pause, "your rage is too violent and unbecoming. You should
be my mother's comforter, and you increase her pain. It ill suited you and
your reverend character, thus to curse your greatest enemy; you should not
have cursed him, villain as he is." "I did not curse him, child, did I?"
"Indeed, sir, you did; you cursed him twice." "Then may Heaven forgive
me and him if I did. And now, my son, I see it was more than human
benevolence that first taught us to bless our enemies. Blessed be His holy
name for all the good He hath given, and for all He hath taken away. But
it is not—it is not a small distress that can wring tears from these old eyes,
that have not wept for so many years. My child—to undo my darling! May
confusion seize—Heaven forgive me!—what am I about to say? You may
remember, my love, how good she was, and how charming: till this vile
moment all her care was to make us happy. Had she but died! But she
is gone; the honour of our family is contaminated, and I must look out for
<a id='Page_77'></a>happiness in other worlds than here. But, my child, you saw them go off:
perhaps he forced her away? If he forced her, she may yet be innocent."
"Ah! no, sir," cried the child; "he only kissed her, and called her his angel,
and she wept very much, and leaned upon his arm, and they drove off very
fast." "She's an ungrateful creature," cried my wife, who could scarcely speak
for weeping, "to use us thus; she never had the least constraint put upon her
affections. The vile strumpet has basely deserted her parents without any provocation—thus
to bring your grey hairs to the grave, and I must shortly follow."</p>

<p class='c009'>In this manner that night, the first of our real misfortunes, was spent
in the bitterness of complaint and ill-supported sallies of enthusiasm. I
determined, however, to find out our betrayer, wherever he was, and reproach
his baseness. The next morning we missed our wretched child at breakfast,
where she used to give life and cheerfulness to us all. My wife, as before,
attempted to ease her heart by reproaches. "Never," cried she, "shall that
vilest stain of our family again darken these harmless doors. I will never call
her daughter more. No! let the strumpet live with her vile seducer: she
may bring us to shame, but she shall never more deceive us."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Wife," said I, "do not talk thus hardly: my detestation of her guilt is
as great as yours; but ever shall this house and this heart be open to a poor
returning repentant sinner. The sooner she returns from her transgressions,
the more welcome shall she be to me. For the first time the very best may
err; art may persuade, and novelty spread out its charm. The first fault is
the child of simplicity, but every other the offspring of guilt. Yes, the
wretched creature shall be welcome to this heart and this house, though
stained with ten thousand vices. I will again hearken to the music of her
voice, again will I hang fondly on her bosom, if I find but repentance there.
My son, bring hither my Bible and my staff; I will pursue her, wherever she
is; and, though I cannot save her from shame, I may prevent the continuance
of her iniquity."</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Though the child could not describe the gentleman's person who handed his
sister into the post-chaise, yet my suspicions fell entirely upon our young
landlord, whose character for such intrigues was but too well known. I
therefore directed my steps towards Thornhill Castle, resolving to upbraid
him, and, if possible, to bring back my daughter; but before I had reached
his seat I was met by one of my parishioners, who said he saw a young lady
<a id='Page_79'></a>resembling my daughter in a post-chaise with a gentleman, whom, by the
description, I could only guess to be Mr. Burchell, and that they drove very
fast. This information, however, did by no means satisfy me; I therefore
went to the young squire's, and, though it was yet early, insisted upon seeing
him immediately; he soon appeared with the most open, familiar air, and
seemed perfectly amazed at my daughter's elopement, protesting upon his
honour that he was quite a stranger to it. I now therefore condemned my
former suspicions, and could turn them only on Mr. Burchell, who I recollected
had of late several private conferences with her; but the appearance
of another witness left me no room to doubt of his villainy, who averred
that he and my daughter were actually gone towards the Wells, about thirty
miles off, where there was a great deal of company. Being driven to that
state of mind in which we are more ready to act precipitately than to reason
right, I never debated with myself whether these accounts might not have
been given by persons purposely placed in my way to mislead me, but resolved
to pursue my daughter and her fancied deluder thither. I walked along with
earnestness, and inquired of several by the way; but received no accounts,
till entering the town, I was met by a person on horseback, whom I remembered
to have seen at the squire's, and he assured me that if I followed them
to the races, which were but thirty miles further, I might depend upon overtaking
them; for he had seen them dance there the night before, and the
whole assembly seemed charmed with my daughter's performance. Early the
next day I walked forward to the races, and about four in the afternoon I
came upon the course. The company made a very brilliant appearance, all
earnestly employed in one pursuit, that of pleasure: how different from mine,
that of reclaiming a lost child to virtue! I thought I perceived Mr. Burchell
at some distance from me; but, as if he dreaded an interview, upon my
approaching him he mixed among a crowd, and I saw him no more.</p>

<p class='c009'>I now reflected, that it would be to no purpose to continue my pursuit
farther, and resolved to return home to an innocent family, who wanted my
assistance. But the agitations of my mind, and the fatigues I had undergone,
threw me into a fever, the symptoms of which I perceived before I came off
the course. This was another unexpected stroke, as I was more than seventy
miles distant from home; however, I retired to a little alehouse by the road-side;
and in this place, the usual retreat of indigence and frugality, I laid me
down patiently to wait the issue of my disorder. I languished here for
nearly three weeks; but at last my constitution prevailed, though I was
<a id='Page_80'></a>unprovided with money to defray the expenses of my entertainment. It is
possible the anxiety from this last circumstance alone might have brought on a
relapse, had I not been supplied by a traveller who stopped to take a cursory
refreshment. This person was no other than the philanthropic bookseller in
St. Paul's Churchyard, who has written so many little books for children:
he called himself their friend, but he was the friend of all mankind. He
was no sooner alighted, but he was in haste to be gone; for he was ever on
business of the utmost importance, and was at that time actually compiling
materials for the history of one Mr. Thomas Trip. I immediately recollected
this good-natured man's red pimpled face; for he had published for me
against the Deuterogamists of the age; and from him I borrowed a few
pieces, to be paid at my return. Leaving the inn, therefore, as I was yet but
weak, I resolved to return home by easy journeys of ten miles a day.</p>

<p class='c009'>My health and usual tranquillity were almost restored, and I now condemned
that pride which had made me refractory to the hand of correction.
Man little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries
them; as in ascending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below,
every step we rise shows us some new and gloomy prospect of hidden disappointment;
so in our descent from the summits of pleasure, though the vale
of misery below may appear at first dark and gloomy, yet the busy mind, still
attentive to its own amusement, finds, as we descend, something to flatter and
to please. Still as we approach the darkest objects appear to brighten, and
the mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>I now proceeded forward, and had walked about two hours, when I
perceived what appeared at a distance like a waggon, which I was resolved to
overtake: but when I came up with it found it to be a strolling company's
cart, that was carrying their scenes and other theatrical furniture to the next
village, where they were to exhibit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cart was attended only by the person who drove it, and one of the
company; as the rest of the players were to follow the ensuing day. "Good
company upon the road," says the proverb, "is the shortest cut." I therefore
entered into conversation with the poor player; and, as I once had some
theatrical powers myself, I descanted on such topics with my usual freedom;
as I was but little acquainted with the present state of the stage, I demanded
who were the present theatrical writers in vogue, who the Drydens
and Otways of the day? "I fancy, sir," cried the player, "few of our modern
dramatists would think themselves much honoured by being compared to the
<a id='Page_81'></a>writers you mention. Dryden's and Rowe's manner, sir, are quite out of
fashion: our taste has gone back a whole century; Fletcher, Ben Jonson,
and all the plays of Shakespeare are the only things that go down." "How!"
cried I, "is it possible the present age can be pleased with that antiquated
dialect, that obsolete humour, those overcharged characters, which abound in
the works you mention?" "Sir," returned my companion, "the public think
nothing about dialect, or humour, or character; for that is none of their business;
they only go to be amused, and find themselves happy when they can
enjoy a pantomime, under the sanction of Jonson's or Shakespeare's name."
"So then, I suppose," cried I, "that our modern dramatists are rather
imitators of Shakespeare than nature?" "To say the truth," returned my
companion, "I don't know that they imitate anything at all; nor indeed does
the public require it of them: it is not the composition of the piece, but the
number of starts and attitudes that may be introduced, that elicits applause.
I have known a piece, with not one jest in the whole, shrugged into popularity,
and another saved by the poet's throwing in a fit of the gripes. No, sir, the
works of Congreve and Farquhar have too much wit in them for the present
taste; our modern dialect is much more natural."</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time the equipage of the strolling company was arrived at the
village, which, it seems, had been apprised of our approach, and was come out
to gaze at us; for my companion observed, that strollers always have more
spectators without doors than within. I did not consider the impropriety of
my being in such company, till I saw a mob gather about me. I therefore
took shelter, as fast as possible, in the first alehouse that offered; and being
shown into the common-room, was accosted by a very well-dressed gentleman,
who demanded whether I was the real chaplain of the company, or whether it
was only to be my masquerade character in the play? Upon my informing
him of the truth, and that I did not belong in any sort to the company, he was
condescending enough to desire me and the player to partake in a bowl of
punch, over which he discussed modern politics with great earnestness and
interest. I set him down in my own mind for nothing less than a parliament
man at least; but was almost confirmed in my conjectures, when, upon asking
what there was in the house for supper, he insisted that the player and I
should sup with him at his house; with which request, after some entreaties,
we were prevailed on to comply.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XIX.</i><br /> <br /><i>The description of a person discontented with the present<br />government, and apprehensive of the loss of our liberties.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The house where we were to be entertained lying at a small distance from the
<a id='Page_83'></a>village, our inviter observed, that, as the coach was not ready, he would
conduct us on foot; and we soon arrived at one of the most magnificent
mansions I had seen in that part of the country. The apartment into which
we were shown was perfectly elegant and modern. He went to give orders for
supper, while the player, with a wink, observed that we were perfectly in luck.
Our entertainer soon returned, an elegant supper was brought in, two or three
ladies in easy dishabille were introduced, and the conversation began with
some sprightliness. Politics, however, was the subject on which our entertainer
chiefly expatiated; for he asserted that liberty was at once his boast and
his terror. After the cloth was removed, he asked me if I had seen the last
Monitor; to which replying in the negative, "What! nor the Auditor, I
suppose?" cried he. "Neither, sir," returned I. "That's strange, very
strange," replied my entertainer. "Now I read all the politics that come out.
The Daily, the Public, the Ledger, the Chronicle, the London Evening, the
Whitehall Evening, the seventeen magazines, and the two reviews; and,
though they hate each other, I love them all. Liberty, sir, liberty is the
Briton's boast, and, by all my coal-mines in Cornwall, I reverence its
guardians." "Then it is to be hoped," cried I, "you reverence the king?"
"Yes," returned my entertainer, "when he does what we would have him;
but if he goes on as he has done of late, I'll never trouble myself more
with his matters. I say nothing. I think only I could have directed some
things better. I don't think there has been a sufficient number of advisers;
he should advise with every person willing to give him advice, and then we
should have things done in another guess manner."</p>

<p class='c009'>"I wish," cried I, "that such intruding advisers were fixed in the pillory.
It should be the duty of honest men to assist the weaker side of our constitution,
that sacred power that has for some years been every day declining
and losing its due share of influence in the state. But these ignorants still
continue the same cry of liberty, and if they have any weight, basely throw it
into the subsiding scale."</p>

<p class='c009'>"How!" cried one of the ladies, "do I live to see one so base, so sordid,
as to be an enemy to liberty, and a defender of tyrants? Liberty, that sacred
gift of heaven, that glorious privilege of Britons!"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Can it be possible," cried our entertainer, "that there should be any
found, at present, advocates for slavery? Any who are for meanly giving up
the privileges of Britons? Can any, sir, be so abject?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"No, sir," replied I, "I am for liberty, that attribute of gods! Glorious
<a id='Page_84'></a>liberty! that theme of modern declamation! I would have all men kings. I
would be a king myself. We have all naturally an equal right to the throne;
we are all originally equal. This is my opinion, and was once the opinion of
a set of honest men who were called levellers. They tried to erect themselves
into a community where all should be equally free. But, alas! it would never
answer; for there were some among them stronger, and some more cunning
than others, and these became masters of the rest; for as sure as your groom
rides your horses, because he is a cunninger animal than they, so surely will
the animal that is cunninger or stronger than he sit upon his shoulders in
turn. Since, then, it is entailed upon humanity to submit, and some are born
to command, and others to obey, the question is, as there must be tyrants,
whether it is better to have them in the same house with us, or in the same
village, or still farther off, in the metropolis. Now, sir, for my own part,
as I naturally hate the face of a tyrant, the farther off he is removed from
me, the better pleased am I. The generality of mankind also are of my
way of thinking, and have unanimously created one king, whose election at
once diminishes the number of tyrants, and puts tyranny at the greatest
distance from the greatest number of people. Now the great, who were
tyrants themselves before the election of one tyrant, are naturally averse to a
power raised over them, and whose weight must ever lean heaviest on the subordinate
orders. It is the interest of the great, therefore, to diminish kingly
power as much as possible; because whatever they take from that is naturally
restored to themselves: and all they have to do in the state is to undermine
the single tyrant, by which they resume their primeval authority. Now the
state may be so circumstanced, or its laws may be so disposed, or its men of
opulence so minded, as all to conspire in carrying on this business of undermining
monarchy. For, in the first place, if the circumstances of our state be
such as to favour the accumulation of wealth, and make the opulent still more
rich, this will increase their ambition. An accumulation of wealth, however,
must necessarily be the consequence, when, as at present, more riches flow in
from external commerce than arise from internal industry: for external commerce
can only be managed to advantage by the rich, and they have also at the
same time all the emoluments arising from internal industry; so that the rich,
with us, have two sources of wealth, whereas the poor have but one. For this
reason, wealth in all commercial states is found to accumulate; and all such
have hitherto in time become aristocratical. Again, the very laws also of the
country may contribute to the accumulation of wealth; as when, by their
<a id='Page_85'></a>means, the natural ties that bind the rich and poor together are broken; and
it is ordained that the rich shall only marry with the rich; or when the
learned are held unqualified to serve their country as councillors, merely from
a defect of opulence; and wealth is thus made the object of a wise man's
ambition: by these means, I say, and such means as these, riches will accumulate.
Now the possessor of accumulated wealth, when furnished with the
necessaries and pleasures of life, has no other method to employ the superfluity
of his fortune but in purchasing power; that is, differently speaking, in
making dependants by purchasing the liberty of the needy or the venal, of
men who are willing to bear the mortification of contiguous tyranny for bread.
Thus each very opulent man generally gathers round him a circle of the
poorest of the people, and the polity abounding in accumulated wealth may be
compared to a Cartesian system, each orb with a vortex of its own. Those,
however, who are willing to move in a great man's vortex, are only such as
must be slaves, the rabble of mankind, whose souls and whose education are
adapted to servitude, and who know nothing of liberty except the name.
But there must still be a large number of the people without the sphere of the
opulent man's influence, namely, that order of men which subsists between the
very rich and the very rabble; those men who are possessed of too large
fortunes to submit to the neighbouring man in power, and yet are too poor to
set up for tyranny themselves. In this middle order of mankind are generally
to be found all the arts, wisdom, and virtues of society. This order alone is
known to be the true preserver of freedom, and may be called THE PEOPLE.
Now it may happen, that this middle order of mankind may lose all its
influence in a state, and its voice be in a manner drowned in that of the rabble;
for if the fortune sufficient for qualifying a person at present to give his voice
in state affairs be ten times less than was judged sufficient upon forming the
constitution, it is evident that greater numbers of the rabble will thus be
introduced into the political system, and they, ever moving in the vortex of the
great, will follow where greatness shall direct. In such a state, therefore, all
that the middle order has left is, to preserve the prerogative and privileges of
the one principal governor with the most sacred circumspection. For he
divides the power of the rich, and calls off the great from falling with
tenfold weight on the middle order placed beneath them. The middle
order may be compared to a town, of which the opulent are forming the
siege, and of which the governor from without is hastening the relief.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>While the besiegers are in dread of an enemy over them, it is but natural
to offer the townsmen the most specious terms: to flatter them with sounds,
and amuse them with privileges; but if they once defeat the governor from
behind, the walls of the town will be but a small defence to its inhabitants.
What they may then expect may be seen by turning our eyes to Holland,
Genoa, or Venice, where the laws govern the poor, and the rich govern the
laws. I am then for, and would die for, monarchy, sacred monarchy; for if
there be anything sacred amongst men, it must be the anointed <i>sovereign</i> of
his people; and every diminution of his power, in war or peace, is an infringement
<a id='Page_87'></a>upon the real liberties of the subject. The sounds of liberty, patriotism,
and Britons, have already done much; it is to be hoped that the true sons of
freedom will prevent their ever doing more. I have known many of these
pretended champions for liberty in my time, yet do I not remember one that
was not in his heart and in his family a tyrant."</p>

<p class='c009'>My warmth, I found, had lengthened this harangue beyond the rules of
good breeding; but the impatience of my entertainer, who often strove to
interrupt it, could be restrained no longer. "What!" cried he, "then I have
been all this while entertaining a Jesuit in parson's clothes? but, by all the
coal-mines of Cornwall, out he shall pack, if my name be Wilkinson." I now
found I had gone too far, and asked pardon for the warmth with which I had
spoken. "Pardon!" returned he, in a fury; "I think such principles demand
ten thousand pardons. What! give up liberty, property, and, as the
Gazetteer says, lie down to be saddled with wooden shoes! Sir, I insist upon
your marching out of this house immediately, to prevent worse consequences.
Sir, I insist upon it." I was going to repeat my remonstrances; but just then
we heard a footman's rap at the door, and the two ladies cried out, "As sure
as death, there is our master and mistress come home!" It seems my entertainer
was all this while only the butler, who, in his master's absence, had a
mind to cut a figure, and be for a while the gentleman himself; and, to say
the truth, he talked politics as well as most country gentlemen do. But
nothing could now exceed my confusion upon seeing the gentleman and his
lady enter; nor was their surprise, at finding such company and good cheer,
less than ours. "Gentlemen," cried the real master of the house to me and
my companion, "my wife and I are your most humble servants; but I protest
this is so unexpected a favour, that we almost sink under the obligation."
However unexpected our company might be to them, theirs, I am sure, was
still more so to us, and I was struck dumb with the apprehensions of my own
absurdity, when whom should I next see enter the room but my dear Miss
Arabella Wilmot, who was formerly designed to be married to my son George;
but whose match was broken off, as already related! As soon as she saw me,
she flew to my arms with the utmost joy. "My dear sir," cried she, "to
what happy accident is it that we owe so unexpected a visit? I am sure my
uncle and aunt will be in raptures when they find they have got the good
Dr. Primrose for their guest." Upon hearing my name, the old gentleman
and lady very politely stepped up, and welcomed me with most cordial hospitality.
Nor could they forbear smiling on being informed of the nature of my
<a id='Page_88'></a>present visit; but the unfortunate butler, whom they at first seemed disposed
to turn away, was at my intercession forgiven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Arnold and his lady, to whom the house belonged, now insisted upon
having the pleasure of my stay for some days; and as their niece, my
charming pupil, whose mind, in some measure, had been formed under my
own instructions, joined in their entreaties, I complied. That night I was
shown to a magnificent chamber, and the next morning early, Miss Wilmot
desired to walk with me in the garden, which was decorated in the modern
manner. After some time spent in pointing out the beauties of the place, she
inquired, with seeming unconcern, when last I had heard from my son George.
"Alas! madam," cried I, "he has now been nearly three years absent, without
ever writing to his friends or me. Where he is I know not; perhaps I shall
never see him or happiness more. No, my dear madam, we shall never more
see such pleasing hours as were once spent by our fireside at Wakefield.
My little family are now dispersing very fast, and poverty has brought not only
want, but infamy, upon us." The good-natured girl let fall a tear at this
account; but as I saw her possessed of too much sensibility, I forbore a more
minute detail of our sufferings. It was, however, some consolation to me to
find that time had made no alteration in her affections, and that she had
rejected several offers that had been made her since our leaving her part of the
country. She led me round all the extensive improvements of the place,
pointing to the several walks and arbours, and at the same time catching from
every object a hint for some new question relative to my son. In this manner
we spent the forenoon, till the bell summoned us to dinner, where we found
the manager of the strolling company that I mentioned before, who was come
to dispose of tickets for the <i>Fair Penitent</i>, which was to be acted that evening:
the part of Horatio by a young gentleman who had never appeared on any
stage. He seemed to be very warm in the praise of the new performer, and
averred that he never saw any one who bade so fair for excellence. Acting,
he observed, was not learned in a day; "but this gentleman," continued he,
"seems born to tread the stage. His voice, his figure, and attitudes, are all
admirable. We caught him up accidentally in our journey down." This
account in some measure excited our curiosity, and, at the entreaty of the
ladies, I was prevailed upon to accompany them to the play-house, which was
no other than a barn. As the company with which I went was incontestably
the chief of the place, we were received with the greatest respect, and placed
in the front seat of the theatre; where we sat for some time with no small
<a id='Page_89'></a>impatience to see Horatio make his appearance. The new performer advanced
at last; and let parents think of my sensations by their own, when I found it
was my unfortunate son! He was going to begin, when, turning his eyes
upon the audience, he perceived Miss Wilmot and me, and stood at once
speechless and immoveable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The actors behind the scenes, who ascribed this pause to his natural
timidity, attempted to encourage him; but, instead of going on, he burst into
a flood of tears, and retired off the stage. I don't know what were my
feelings on this occasion, for they succeeded with too much rapidity for
description; but I was soon awakened from this disagreeable reverie by Miss
Wilmot, who, pale and with a trembling voice, desired me to conduct her
back to her uncle's. When got home, Mr. Arnold, who was as yet a stranger
to our extraordinary behaviour, being informed that the new performer was
my son, sent his coach and an invitation for him; and, as he persisted in his
refusal to appear again upon the stage, the players put another in his place,
and we soon had him with us. Mr. Arnold gave him the kindest reception,
and I received him with my usual transport; for I could never counterfeit
false resentment. Miss Wilmot's reception was mixed with seeming neglect,
and yet I could perceive she acted a studied part. The tumult in her
mind seemed not yet abated; she said twenty giddy things that looked like
joy, and then laughed loud at her own want of meaning. At intervals she
would take a sly peep at the glass, as if happy in the consciousness of irresistible
beauty; and often would ask questions, without giving any manner of
attention to the answers.</p>

<p class='c008'>After we had supped, Mrs. Arnold politely offered to send a couple of her
footmen for my son's baggage, which he at first seemed to decline; but, upon
her pressing the request, he was obliged to inform her, that a stick and a
wallet were all the moveable things upon this earth which he could boast of.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>"Why, ay, my son," cried I, "you left me but poor; and poor, I find, you
are come back; and yet, I make no doubt, you have seen a great deal of
the world." "Yes, sir," replied my son; "but travelling after fortune is not
the way to secure her: and, indeed, of late I have desisted from the pursuit."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_91'></a>"I fancy, sir," cried Mrs. Arnold, "that the account of your adventures would
be amusing: the first part of them I have often heard from my niece; but
could the company prevail for the rest, it would be an additional obligation."
"Madam," replied my son, "I promise you the pleasure you have in hearing
will not be half so great as my vanity in repeating them; and yet in the
whole narrative I can scarcely promise you one adventure, as my account is
rather of what I saw than what I did. The first misfortune of my life, which
you all know, was great; but though it distressed, it could not sink me. No
person ever had a better knack of hoping than I. The less kind I found
Fortune at one time, the more I expected from her at another; and being now
at the bottom of her wheel, every new revolution might lift, but could not
depress me. I proceeded, therefore, towards London on a fine morning, no
way uneasy about to-morrow, but cheerful as the birds that carolled by the
road; and comforted myself with reflecting that London was the mart where
abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Upon my arrival in town, sir, my first care was to deliver your letter of
recommendation to our cousin, who was himself in little better circumstances
than I. My first scheme, you know, sir, was to be usher at an academy, and
I asked his advice on the affair. Our cousin received the proposal with a true
sardonic grin. 'Ay,' cried he, 'this is, indeed, a very pretty career that has
been chalked out for you. I have been an usher to a boarding-school myself;
and may I die by an anodyne necklace, but I had rather be an under-turnkey
in Newgate! I was up early and late: I was browbeat by the master, hated
for my ugly face by the mistress, worried by the boys within, and never permitted
to stir out to meet civility abroad. But are you sure you are fit for a
school? Let me examine you a little. Have you been bred apprentice to the
business?' 'No.' 'Then you won't do for a school. Can you dress the
boys' hair?' 'No.' 'Then you won't do for a school. Have you had the
small-pox?' 'No.' 'Then you won't do for a school. Can you lie three
in a bed?' 'No.' 'Then you will never do for a school. Have you got a
good stomach?' 'Yes.' 'Then you will by no means do for a school. No,
sir; if you are for a genteel, easy profession, bind yourself seven years as an
apprentice to turn a cutler's wheel; but avoid a school by any means. Yet
come,' continued he, 'I see you are a lad of spirit and some learning; what
do you think of commencing author, like me? You have read in books, no
doubt, of men of genius starving at the trade; at present I'll show you forty
very dull fellows about town that live by it in opulence—all honest jog-trot
<a id='Page_92'></a>men, who go on smoothly and dully, write history and politics, and are
praised: men, sir, who, had they been bred cobblers, would all their lives
have only mended shoes, but never made them.'</p>

<p class='c009'>"Finding that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the
character of an usher, I resolved to accept his proposal; and, having the
highest respect for literature, hailed the <i>Antiqua Mater</i> of Grub-street with
reverence. I thought it my glory to pursue a track which Dryden and Otway
trod before me. I considered the goddess of this region as the parent of
excellence; and, however an intercourse with the world might give us good
sense, the poverty she entailed I supposed to be the nurse of genius. Big
with these reflections I sat down, and, finding that the best things remained
to be said on the wrong side, I resolved to write a book that should be wholly
new. I therefore dressed up three paradoxes with some ingenuity. They
were false, indeed, but they were new. The jewels of truth have been so often
imported by others, that nothing was left for me to import but some splendid
things that, at a distance, looked every bit as well. Witness, you powers,
what fancied importance sat perched upon my quill while I was writing! The
whole learned world, I made no doubt, would rise to oppose my systems; but
then I was prepared to oppose the whole learned world. Like the porcupine,
I sat self-collected, with a quill pointed against every opposer."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Well said, my boy!" cried I; "and what subject did you treat upon? I
hope you did not pass over the importance of monogamy? But I interrupt:
go on. You published your paradoxes; well, and what did the learned world
say to your paradoxes?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Sir," replied my son, "the learned world said nothing to my paradoxes;
nothing at all, sir. Every man of them was employed in praising his friends
and himself, or condemning his enemies; and, unfortunately, as I had neither,
I suffered the cruellest mortification—neglect.</p>

<p class='c009'>"As I was meditating one day, in a coffee-house, on the fate of my paradoxes,
a little man happening to enter the room, placed himself in the box
before me; and, after some preliminary discourse, finding me to be a scholar,
drew out a bundle of proposals, begging me to subscribe to a new edition he
was going to give the world of Propertius, with notes. This demand necessarily
produced a reply that I had no money; and that concession led him to
inquire into the nature of my expectations. Finding that my expectations
were just as great as my purse, 'I see,' cried he, 'you are unacquainted with
the town. I'll teach you a part of it.—Look at these proposals; upon these
<a id='Page_93'></a>very proposals I have subsisted very comfortably for twelve years. The
moment a nobleman returns from his travels, a Creolian arrives from Jamaica,
or a dowager from her country-seat, I strike for a subscription. I first besiege
their hearts with flattery, and then pour in my proposals at the breach. If
they subscribe readily the first time, I renew my request to beg a dedication
fee; if they let me have that, I smite them once more for engraving their coat
of arms at the top. Thus,' continued he, 'I live by vanity, and laugh at it.
But, between ourselves, I am now too well known; I should be glad to borrow
your face a bit: a nobleman of distinction has just returned from Italy; my
face is familiar to his porter: but, if you bring this copy of verses, my life for
it, you succeed, and we divide the spoil.'"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Bless us! George," cried I, "and is this the employment of poets now?
Do men of their exalted talents thus stoop to beggary? Can they so far
disgrace their calling as to make a vile traffic of praise for bread?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Oh, no, sir," returned he; "a true poet can never be so base; for, wherever
there is genius there is pride. The creatures I now describe are only beggars
in rhyme. The real poet, as he braves every hardship for fame, so is he equally
a coward to contempt: and none but those who are unworthy of protection
condescend to solicit it.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Having a mind too proud to stoop to such indignities, and yet a fortune
too humble to hazard a second attempt for fame, I was now obliged to take a
middle course, and write for bread. But I was unqualified for a profession
where mere industry alone was to insure success. I could not suppress my
lurking passion for applause; but usually consumed that time in efforts after
excellence, which takes up but little room, when it should have been more
advantageously employed in the diffusive productions of fruitful mediocrity.
My little piece would, therefore, come forth in the midst of periodical
publications, unnoticed and unknown. The public were more importantly employed
than to observe the easy simplicity of my style, or the harmony of my periods.
Sheet after sheet was thrown off to oblivion. My essays were buried among
the essays upon liberty, eastern tales, and cures for the bite of a mad dog;
while Philautos, Philalethes, and Philelutheros, and Philanthropos, all wrote
better, because they wrote faster than I.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Now, therefore, I began to associate with none but disappointed authors
like myself, who praised, deplored, and despised each other. The satisfaction
we found in every celebrated writer's attempts was inversely as their merits.
I found that no genius in another could please me: my unfortunate paradoxes
<a id='Page_94'></a>had entirely dried up that source of comfort. I could neither read nor write
with satisfaction; for excellence in another was my aversion, and writing was
my trade.</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'>"In the midst of these gloomy reflections, as I was one day sitting on a
bench in St. James's Park, a young gentleman of distinction, who had been
my intimate acquaintance at the university, approached me. We saluted each
other with some hesitation: he almost ashamed of being known to one who
made so shabby an appearance, and I afraid of a repulse. But my suspicions
soon vanished; for Ned Thornhill was at the bottom a very good-natured
fellow."</p>

<p class='c009'>"What did you say, George?" interrupted I. "Thornhill! was not that
his name? It can certainly be no other than my landlord." "Bless me!"
cried Mrs. Arnold, "is Mr. Thornhill so near a neighbour of yours? He has
long been a friend in our family, and we expect a visit from him shortly."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_95'></a>"My friend's first care," continued my son, "was to alter my appearance
by a very fine suit of his own clothes, and then I was admitted to his table

him at auctions, to put him in spirits when he sat for his picture, to take the
left hand in his chariot when not filled by another, and to assist at tattering a
kip, as the phrase was, when he had a mind for a frolic. Besides this, I had
twenty other little employments in the family. I was to do many small
things without bidding; to carry the corkscrew; to stand godfather to all
the butler's children; to sing when I was bid; to be never out of humour;
always to be humble; and, if I could, to be very happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>"In this honourable post, however, I was not without a rival. A captain
of marines, who was formed for the place by nature, opposed me in my
patron's affections. His mother had been laundress to a man of quality, and
thus he early acquired a taste for pimping and pedigree. As this gentleman
made it the study of his life to be acquainted with lords, though he was dismissed
from several for his stupidity, yet he found many of them, who were as
dull as himself, that permitted his assiduities. As flattery was his trade, he
practised it with the easiest address imaginable; but it came awkward and
stiff from me; and as every day my patron's desire of flattery increased, so
every hour, being better acquainted with his defects, I became more unwilling
to give it. Thus I was once more fairly going to give up the field to the
captain, when my friend found occasion for my assistance. This was nothing
less than to fight a duel for him with a gentleman whose sister it was pretended
he had used ill. I readily complied with his request, and though I see
you are displeased at my conduct, yet, as it was a debt indispensably due to
friendship, I could not refuse. I undertook the affair, disarmed my antagonist,
and soon after had the pleasure of finding that the lady was only a woman of
the town, and the fellow her bully and a sharper. This piece of service was
repaid with the warmest professions of gratitude; but as my friend was to
leave town in a few days, he knew no other method of serving me but by
recommending me to his uncle, Sir William Thornhill, and another nobleman
of great distinction, who enjoyed a post under the government. When he
was gone, my first care was to carry his recommendatory letter to his uncle, a
man whose character for every virtue was universal, yet just. I was received
by his servants with the most hospitable smiles, for the looks of the domestics
ever transmit their master's benevolence. Being shown into a grand apartment,
where Sir William soon came to me, I delivered my message and letter, which
<a id='Page_96'></a>he read, and after pausing some minutes, 'Pray, sir,' cried he, 'inform me
what you have done for my kinsman to deserve this warm recommendation.
But I suppose, sir, I guess your merits: you have fought for him; and so you
would expect a reward from me for being the instrument of his vices. I wish,
sincerely wish, that my present refusal may be some punishment for your
guilt; but still more that it may be some inducement to your repentance.'
The severity of this rebuke I bore patiently, because I knew that it was just.
My whole expectations now, therefore, lay in my letter to the great man. As
the doors of the nobility are almost ever beset with beggars, all ready to
thrust in some sly petition, I found it no easy matter to gain admittance.
However, after bribing the servants with half my worldly fortune, I was at last
shown into a spacious apartment, my letter being previously sent up for his
lordship's inspection. During this anxious interval I had full time to look
around me. Everything was grand and of happy contrivance: the paintings,
the furniture, the gildings, petrified me with awe, and raised my idea of the
owner. Ah! thought I to myself, how very great must the possessor of all
these things be, who carries in his head the business of the state, and whose
house displays half the wealth of a kingdom; sure his genius must be unfathomable!
During these awful reflections I heard a step come heavily
forward. Ah, this is the great man himself! No, it was only a chambermaid.
Another foot was heard soon after. This must be he! No, it was only the
great man's <i>valet-de-chambre</i>. At last his lordship actually made his appearance.
'Are you,' cried he, 'the bearer of this here letter?' I answered
with a bow. 'I learn by this,' continued he, 'as how that—' But just at
that instant a servant delivered him a card; and without taking further notice
he went out of the room, and left me to digest my own happiness at leisure.
I saw no more of him, till told by a footman that his lordship was going to his
coach at the door. Down I immediately followed, and joined my voice to that
of three or four more, who came like me to petition for favours. His lordship,
however, went too fast for us, and was gaining his chariot-door with large
strides, when I hallooed out to know if I was to have any reply. He was by
this time got in, and muttered an answer, half of which only I heard, the other
half was lost in the rattling of his chariot-wheels. I stood for some time with
my neck stretched out, in the posture of one that was listening to catch the
glorious sounds, till, looking round me, I found myself alone at his lordship's
gate.</p>

<p class='c009'>"My patience," continued my son, "was now quite exhausted. Stung
<a id='Page_97'></a>with the thousand indignities I had met with, I was willing to cast myself
away, and only wanted the gulf to receive me. I regarded myself as one of
those vile things that Nature designed should be thrown by into her lumber-room,
there to perish in obscurity. I had still, however, half-a-guinea left, and
of that I thought Fortune herself should not deprive me; but, in order to be
sure of this, I was resolved to go instantly and spend it while I had it, and
then trust to occurrences for the rest. As I was going along with this resolution,
it happened that Mr. Crispe's office seemed invitingly open to give me a
welcome reception. In this office Mr. Crispe kindly offers all his majesty's
subjects a generous promise of thirty pounds a-year, for which promise all they
give in return is their liberty for life, and permission to let him transport them
to America as slaves. I was happy at finding a place where I could lose my
fears in desperation, and entered this cell, for it had the appearance of one,
with the devotion of a monastic. Here I found a number of poor creatures,
all in circumstances like myself, expecting the arrival of Mr. Crispe, presenting
a true epitome of English impatience. Each untractable soul at variance with
fortune wreaked her injuries on their own hearts; but Mr. Crispe at last came
down, and all our murmurs were hushed. He deigned to regard me with an
air of peculiar approbation, and indeed he was the first man who, for a month
past, talked to me with smiles. After a few questions, he found I was fit for
everything in the world. He paused awhile upon the properest means of providing
for me, and slapping his forehead as if he had found it, assured me that
there was at that time an embassy talked of from the synod of Pennsylvania
to the Chickasaw Indians, and that he would use his interest to get me made
secretary. I knew in my own heart that the fellow lied, and yet his promise
gave me pleasure, there was something so magnificent in the sound. I fairly,
therefore, divided my half-guinea, one-half of which went to be added to his
thirty thousand pounds, and with the other half I resolved to go to the next
tavern, to be there more happy than he.</p>

<p class='c009'>"As I was going out with that resolution, I was met at the door by the
captain of a ship, with whom I had formerly some little acquaintance, and he
agreed to be my companion over a bowl of punch. As I never chose to make
a secret of my circumstances, he assured me that I was upon the very point of
ruin, in listening to the office-keeper's promises; for that he only designed to
sell me to the plantations. 'But,' continued he, 'I fancy you might by a
much shorter voyage be very easily put into a genteel way of bread. Take my
advice. My ship sails to-morrow for Amsterdam; what if you go in her as a
passenger? The moment you land, all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen
English, and I warrant you'll get pupils and money enough. I suppose you
understand English,' added he, 'by this time, or the deuce is in it.'</p>

<p>"<i>Whenever I approached a peasant's house<br />towards nightfall, I played one of my most<br />merry tunes, and this procured me not only<br />a lodging, but subsistence for the next day.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 99.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_99'></a>I confidently assured him of that; but expressed a doubt whether the Dutch
would be willing to learn English. He affirmed, with an oath, that they were
fond of it to distraction; and upon that affirmation I agreed with his proposal,
and embarked with him the next day to teach the Dutch English in Holland.
The wind was fair, our voyage short; and, after having paid my passage with
half my moveables, I found myself, as fallen from the skies, a stranger in one
of the principal streets of Amsterdam. In this situation I was unwilling to
let any time pass unemployed in teaching. I addressed myself, therefore, to
two or three of those I met, whose appearance seemed most promising; but it
was impossible to make ourselves mutually understood. It was not till this
very moment I recollected that, in order to teach Dutchmen English, it was
necessary that they should first teach me Dutch. How I came to overlook so
obvious an objection is to me amazing; but certain it is I overlooked it.</p>

<p class='c009'>"This scheme thus blown up, I had some thoughts of fairly shipping back
to England again; but falling into company with an Irish student who was
returning from Louvain, our conversation turning upon topics of literature (for
by the way, it may be observed, that I always forgot the meanness of my circumstances
when I could converse on such subjects), from him I learned that
there were not two men in his whole university who understood Greek. This
amazed me: I instantly resolved to travel to Louvain, and there live by teaching
Greek; and in this design I was heartened by my brother-student, who
threw out some hints that a fortune might be got by it.</p>

<p class='c009'>"I set boldly forward the next morning. Every day lessened the burthen
of my moveables, like Æsop and his basket of bread; for I paid them for my
lodgings to the Dutch as I travelled on. When I came to Louvain, I was
resolved not to go sneaking to the lower professors, but openly tendered my
talents to the principal himself. I went, had admittance, and offered him my
service as a master of the Greek language, which I had been told was a
desideratum in his university. The principal seemed, at first, to doubt of my
abilities; but of these I offered to convince him, by turning a part of any
Greek author he should fix upon into Latin. Finding me perfectly earnest in
my proposal, he addressed me thus: 'You see me, young man: I never
learned Greek, and I don't find that I have ever missed it. I have had a
doctor's cap and gown without Greek; I have ten thousand florins a-year
without Greek; I eat heartily without Greek; and, in short,' continued he, 'as
I don't know Greek, I do not believe there is any good in it.'</p>

<p class='c009'>"I was now too far from home to think of returning, so I resolved to go
<a id='Page_100'></a>forward. I had some knowledge of music, with a tolerable voice; I now
turned what was once my amusement into a present means of subsistence. I
passed among the harmless peasants of Flanders, and among such of the
French as were poor enough to be very merry; for I ever found them sprightly
in proportion to their wants. Whenever I approached a peasant's house
towards nightfall, I played one of my most merry tunes, and that procured
me not only a lodging, but subsistence for the next day. I once or twice
attempted to play for people of fashion; but they always thought my performance
odious, and never rewarded me even with a trifle. This was to me the
more extraordinary, as whenever I used in better days to play for company,
when playing was my amusement, my music never failed to throw them into
raptures, and the ladies especially; but, as it was now my only means, it was
received with contempt: a proof how ready the world is to underrate those
talents by which a man is supported.</p>

<p class='c009'>"In this manner I proceeded to Paris, with no design but just to look
about me, and then to go forward. The people of Paris are much fonder of
strangers that have money than of those that have wit. As I could not boast
much of either, I was no great favourite. After walking about the town four
or five days, and seeing the outsides of the best houses, I was preparing to
leave this retreat of venal hospitality; when, passing through one of the
principal streets, whom should I meet but our cousin, to whom you first
recommended me! This meeting was very agreeable to me, and I believe not
displeasing to him. He inquired into the nature of my journey to Paris, and
informed me of his own business there, which was to collect pictures, medals,
intaglios, and antiques of all kinds, for a gentleman in London, who had just
stepped into taste and a large fortune. I was the more surprised at seeing
our cousin pitched upon for this office, as he himself had often assured me he
knew nothing of the matter. Upon asking how he had been taught the art of
a <i>cognoscento</i> so very suddenly, he assured me that nothing was more easy.
The whole secret consisted in a strict adherence to two rules: the one, always
to observe that the picture might have been better if the painter had taken
more pains; and the other, to praise the works of Pietro Perugino. 'But,'
says he, 'as I once taught you how to be an author in London, I'll now
undertake to instruct you in the art of picture-buying in Paris.'</p>

<p class='c009'>"With this proposal I very readily closed, as it was a living; and now all
my ambition was to live. I went therefore to his lodgings, improved my dress
by his assistance; and, after some time, accompanied him to auctions of
<a id='Page_101'></a>pictures, where the English gentry were expected to be purchasers. I was not
a little surprised at his intimacy with people of the best fashion, who referred
themselves to his judgment upon every picture or medal, as to an unerring
standard of taste. He made very good use of my assistance upon these
occasions; for when asked his opinion, he would gravely take me aside and
ask mine, shrug, look wise, return, and assure the company that he could give
no opinion upon an affair of so much importance. Yet there was sometimes
an occasion for a more supported assurance. I remember to have seen him,
after giving his opinion that the colouring of a picture was not mellow enough,
very deliberately take a brush with brown varnish that was accidentally lying
by, and rub it over the piece with great composure before all the company,
and then ask if he had not improved the tints.</p>

<p class='c009'>"When he had finished his commission in Paris, he left me strongly
recommended to several men of distinction, as a person very proper for a
travelling tutor; and, after some time, I was employed in that capacity by a
gentleman who brought his ward to Paris in order to set him forward on his
tour through Europe. I was to be the young gentleman's governor, but with
a proviso that he should always be permitted to govern himself. My pupil, in
fact, understood the art of guiding in money concerns much better than I.
He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thousand pounds, left him by
an uncle in the West Indies; and his guardians, to qualify him for the
management of it, had bound him apprentice to an attorney. Thus avarice
was his prevailing passion: all his questions on the road were, how much
money might be saved; which was the least expensive course of travelling;
whether anything could be bought that would turn to account when disposed
of again in London. Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing
he was ready enough to look at; but if the sight of them was to be paid for,
he usually asserted that he had been told they were not worth seeing. He
never paid a bill that he would not observe how amazingly expensive travelling
was! And all this though he was not yet twenty-one. When arrived at
Leghorn, as we took a walk to look at the port and shipping, he inquired the
expense of the passage by sea home to England. This he was informed was
but a trifle compared to his returning by land: he was therefore unable to
withstand the temptation; so, paying me the small part of my salary that was
due, he took leave, and embarked with only one attendant for London.</p>

<p class='c009'>"I now therefore was left once more upon the world at large; but then it
was a thing I was used to. However, my skill in music could avail me
<a id='Page_102'></a>nothing in a country where every peasant was a better musician than I; but
by this time I had acquired another talent which answered my purpose as
well, and this was a skill in disputation. In all the foreign universities and
convents there are, upon certain days, philosophical theses maintained against
every adventitious disputant; for which, if the champion opposes with any
dexterity, he can claim a gratuity in money, a dinner, and a bed for one night.
In this manner, therefore, I fought my way towards England; walked along
from city to city; examined mankind more nearly; and, if I may so express
it, saw both sides of the picture. My remarks, however, are but few; I
found that monarchy was the best government for the poor to live in, and
commonwealths for the rich. I found that riches in general were in every
country another name for freedom; and that no man is so fond of liberty
himself as not to be desirous of subjecting the will of some individuals in
society to his own.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_103'></a>"Upon my arrival in England, I resolved to pay my respects first to you,
and then to enlist as a volunteer in the first expedition that was going forward;
but on my journey down my resolutions were changed by meeting an old
acquaintance, who I found belonged to a company of comedians that were
going to make a summer campaign in the country. The company seemed not
much to disapprove of me for an associate. They all, however, apprised me
of the importance of the task at which I aimed; that the public was a many-headed
monster, and that only such as had very good heads could please it;
that acting was not to be learnt in a day; and that without some traditional
shrugs, which had been on the stage, and only on the stage, these hundred
years, I could never pretend to please. The next difficulty was in fitting me
with parts, as almost every character was in keeping. I was driven for some
time from one character to another, till at last Horatio was fixed upon, which
the presence of the present company has happily hindered me from acting."</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XXI.</i><br /> <br /><i>The short continuance of friendship among the vicious,<br />which is coeval only with mutual satisfaction.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>My son's account was too long to be delivered at once; the first part of it
was begun that night, and he was concluding the rest after dinner the next
day, when the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equipage at the door seemed to
make a pause in the general satisfaction. The butler, who was now become
my friend in the family, informed me in a whisper that the squire had already
made some overtures to Miss Wilmot, and that her aunt and uncle seemed
highly to approve the match. Upon Mr. Thornhill's entering, he seemed, at
seeing my son and me, to start back: but I readily imputed that to surprise,
and not displeasure. However, upon our advancing to salute him, he returned
our greeting with the most apparent candour; and after a short time his
presence served only to increase the general good humour.</p>

<p class='c009'>After tea, he called me aside to inquire after my daughter; but upon my
informing him that my inquiry was unsuccessful, he seemed greatly surprised,
adding that he had since been frequently at my house in order to comfort the
<a id='Page_104'></a>rest of my family, whom he left perfectly well. He then asked if I had
communicated her misfortune to Miss Wilmot or my son; and upon my
replying that I had not told them as yet, he greatly approved my prudence
and precaution, desiring me by all means to keep it a secret. "For at best,"
cried he, "it is but divulging one's own infamy; and perhaps Miss Livy may
not be so guilty as we all imagine." We were here interrupted by a servant,
who came to ask the squire in, to stand up at country-dances, so that he left
me quite pleased with the interest he seemed to take in my concerns. His
addresses, however, to Miss Wilmot, were too obvious to be mistaken; and
yet she seemed not perfectly pleased, but bore them rather in compliance to
the will of her aunt than from real inclination. I had even the satisfaction to
see her lavish some kind looks upon my unfortunate son, which the other
could neither extort by his fortune nor assiduity. Mr. Thornhill's seeming
composure, however, not a little surprised me. We had now continued here
a week, at the pressing instances of Mr. Arnold; but each day, the more
tenderness Miss Wilmot showed my son, Mr. Thornhill's friendship seemed
proportionably to increase for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had formerly made us the most kind assurances of using his interest
to serve the family; but now his generosity was not confined to promises
alone. The morning I designed for my departure Mr. Thornhill came to me
with looks of real pleasure, to inform me of a piece of service he had done for
his friend George. This was nothing less than his having procured him an
ensign's commission in one of the regiments that were going to the West
Indies, for which he had promised but one hundred pounds, his interest
having been sufficient to get an abatement of the other two. "As for this
trifling piece of service," continued the young gentleman, "I desire no other
reward but the pleasure of having served my friend; and as for the hundred
pounds to be paid, if you are unable to raise it yourselves, I will advance it,
and you shall repay me at your leisure." This was a favour we wanted words
to express our sense of; I readily, therefore, gave my bond for the money, and
testified as much gratitude as if I never intended to pay.</p>

<p class='c009'>George was to depart for town the next day to secure his commission, in
pursuance of his generous patron's directions, who judged it highly expedient
to use despatch, lest in the meantime another should step in with more
advantageous proposals. The next morning, therefore, our young soldier was
early prepared for his departure, and seemed the only person among us that
was not affected by it. Neither the fatigues and dangers he was going to
<a id='Page_105'></a>encounter, nor the friends and mistress (for Miss Wilmot actually loved him)
he was leaving behind, any way damped his spirits. After he had taken leave
of the rest of the company, I gave him all that I had—my blessing. "And
now, my boy," cried I, "thou art going to fight for thy country, remember
how thy brave grandfather fought for his sacred king, when loyalty among
Britons was a virtue. Go, my boy, and imitate him in all but his misfortunes—if
it was a misfortune to die with Lord Falkland. Go, my boy,
and if you fall, though distant, exposed, and unwept by those that love you,
the most precious tears are those with which Heaven bedews the unburied
head of a soldier."</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning I took leave of the good family that had been kind
enough to entertain me so long, not without several expressions of gratitude
to Mr. Thornhill for his late bounty. I left them in the enjoyment of all that
happiness which affluence and good breeding procure, and returned towards
home, despairing of ever finding my daughter more, but sending a sigh to
Heaven to spare and to forgive her. I was now come within about twenty
miles of home, having hired a horse to carry me, as I was yet but weak, and
comforted myself with the hopes of soon seeing all I held dearest upon earth.
But the night coming on, I put up at a little public-house by the road-side,
and asked for the landlord's company over a pint of wine. We sat beside his
kitchen fire, which was the best room in the house, and chatted on politics
and the news of the country. We happened, among other topics, to talk of
young Squire Thornhill, who, the host assured me, was hated as much as his
uncle, Sir William, who sometimes came down to the country, was loved. He
went on to observe that he made it his whole study to betray the daughters of
such as received him to their houses, and after a fortnight or three weeks'
possession turned them out unrewarded and abandoned to the world. As we
continued our discourse in this manner, his wife, who had been out to get
change, returned, and perceiving that her husband was enjoying a pleasure in
which she was not a sharer, she asked him in an angry tone what he did there,
to which he only replied in an ironical way by drinking her health. "Mr.
Symonds," cried she, "you use me very ill, and I'll bear it no longer. Here
three parts of the business is left for me to do, and the fourth left unfinished,
while you do nothing but soak with the guests all day long; whereas, if a
spoonful of liquor were to cure me of a fever, I never touch a drop." I now
found what she would be at, and immediately poured her out a glass, which
she received with a courtesy, and drinking towards my good health.</p>

<p>"<i>Out, I say; pack out this moment</i>!"—<i>p.</i> 106.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>"Sir," resumed she, "it is not so much for the value of the liquor I am angry, but one
cannot help it when the house is going out of the windows. If the customers
or guests are to be dunned, all the burden lies upon my back: he'd as leave
<a id='Page_107'></a>eat that glass as budge after them himself. There, now, above stairs we have a
young woman who has come to take up her lodgings here, and I don't believe
she has got any money, by her over-civility. I am certain she is very slow of
payment, and I wish she were put in mind of it." "What signifies minding
her?" cried the host; "if she be slow she's sure." "I don't know that,"
replied the wife, "but I know that I am sure she has been here a fortnight,
and we have not yet seen the cross of her money." "I suppose, my dear,"
cried he, "we shall have it all in a lump." "In a lump!" cried the other,
"I hope we may get it any way; and that I am resolved we will this very
night, or out she tramps, bag and baggage." "Consider, my dear," cried the
husband, "she is a gentlewoman, and deserves more respect." "As for the
matter of that," returned the hostess, "gentle or simple, out she shall pack
with a sassarara. Gentry may be good things where they take; but for my
part, I never saw much good of them at the sign of the Harrow." Thus
saying, she ran up a narrow flight of stairs that went from the kitchen to a
room overhead, and I soon perceived by the loudness of her voice, and the
bitterness of her reproaches, that no money was to be had from her lodger.
I could hear her remonstrances very distinctly. "Out, I say; pack out this
moment! tramp, thou infamous strumpet, or I'll give thee a mark thou won't
be the better for these three months. What! you trumpery, to come and
take up an honest house without cross or coin to bless yourself with! Come
along, I say." "Oh, dear madam," cried the stranger, "pity me, pity a poor
abandoned creature for one night, and death will soon do the rest." I
instantly knew the voice of my poor ruined child Olivia. I flew to her rescue,
while the woman was dragging her along by the hair, and I caught the dear
forlorn wretch in my arms. "Welcome, any way welcome, my dearest lost
one, my treasure, to your poor old father's bosom! Though the vicious
forsake thee, there is yet one in the world that will never forsake thee;
though thou hadst ten thousand crimes to answer for, he will forgive them
all." "Oh, my own dear"—for minutes she could say no more—"my own
dearest, good papa! Could angels be kinder? How do I deserve so much?
The villain, I hate him and myself, to be a reproach to so much goodness.
You can't forgive me—I know you cannot." "Yes, my child, from my heart
I do forgive thee: only repent, and we both shall yet be happy. We shall see
many pleasant days yet, my Olivia." "Ah! never, sir, never! The rest of
my wretched life must be infamy abroad, and shame at home. But alas!
papa, you look much paler than you used to do. Could such a thing as I am
<a id='Page_108'></a>give you so much uneasiness? surely you have too much wisdom to take the
miseries of my guilt upon yourself!" "Our wisdom, young woman—" replied
I. "Ah! why so cold a name, papa?" cried she, "this is the first time you
ever called me by so cold a name." "I ask pardon, my darling," returned I;
"but I was going to observe, that wisdom makes but a slow defence against
trouble, though at last a sure one."</p>

<p class='c009'>The landlady now returned to know if we did not choose a more genteel
apartment; to which assenting, we were shown to a room where we could
converse more freely. After we had talked ourselves into some tranquillity, I
could not avoid desiring some account of the gradations that led to her
present wretched situation. "That villain, sir," said she, "from the first day
of our meeting, made me honourable though private proposals."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Villain, indeed!" cried I; "and yet it in some measure surprises me how
a person of Mr. Burchell's good sense and seeming honour could be guilty of
such deliberate baseness, and thus step into a family to undo it."</p>

<p class='c009'>"My dear papa," returned my daughter, "you labour under a strange
mistake. Mr. Burchell never attempted to deceive me. Instead of that, he
took every opportunity of privately admonishing me against the artifices of
Mr. Thornhill, who, I now find, was even worse than he represented him."
"Mr. Thornhill!" interrupted I, "can it be?" "Yes, sir," returned she,
"it was Mr. Thornhill who seduced me; who employed the two ladies, as he
called them, but who in fact were abandoned women of the town without
breeding or pity, to decoy us up to London. Their artifices, you may
remember, would certainly have succeeded, but for Mr. Burchell's letter, who
directed those reproaches at them which we all applied to ourselves. How he
came to have so much influence as to defeat their intentions, still remains a
secret to me; but I am convinced he was ever our warmest, sincerest friend."</p>

<p class='c009'>"You amaze me, my dear," cried I; "but now I find my first suspicions
of Mr. Thornhill's baseness were too well grounded: but he can triumph in
security; for he is rich and we are poor. But tell me, my child; sure it was
no small temptation that could thus obliterate all the impressions of such an
education and so virtuous a disposition as thine?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Indeed, sir," replied she, "he owes all his triumph to the desire I had
of making him, and not myself, happy. I knew that the ceremony of our
marriage, which was privately performed by a popish priest, was no way
binding, and that I had nothing to trust to but his honour." "What!"
interrupted I, "and were you indeed married by a priest, and in orders?"
<a id='Page_109'></a>"Indeed, sir, we were," replied she, "though we were both sworn to conceal
his name." "Why then, my child, come to my arms again; and now you are
a thousand times more welcome than before; for you are his wife to all intents
and purposes; nor can all the laws of man, though written upon tables of
adamant, lessen the force of that sacred connexion."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Alas! papa," replied she, "you are but little acquainted with his
villainies; he has been married already, by the same priest, to six or eight
wives more, whom, like me, he has deceived and abandoned."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Has he so?" cried I, "then we must hang the priest, and you shall inform
against him to-morrow." "But, sir," returned she, "will that be right, when
I am sworn to secresy?" "My dear," I replied, "if you have made such a
promise, I cannot, nor will I tempt you to break it. Even though it may
benefit the public, you must not inform against him. In all human institutions,
a smaller evil is allowed to procure a greater good: as, in politics, a
province may be given away to secure a kingdom; in medicine, a limb may
be lopped off to preserve the body. But in religion the law is written and
inflexible, <i>never</i> to do evil. And, this law, my child, is right; for otherwise,
if we commit a smaller evil to procure a greater good, certain guilt would be
thus incurred in expectation of contingent advantage. And though the advantage
should certainly follow, yet the interval between commission and
advantage, which is allowed to be guilty, may be that in which we are called
away to answer for the things we have done, and the volume of human actions
is closed for ever. But I interrupt you, my dear: go on."</p>

<p class='c009'>"The very next morning," continued she, "I found what little expectations
I was to have from his sincerity. That very morning he introduced me
to two unhappy women more, whom, like me, he had deceived, but who lived
in contented prostitution. I loved him too tenderly to bear such rivals in his
affections, and strove to forget my infamy in a tumult of pleasures. With this
view, I danced, dressed, and talked, but still was unhappy. The gentlemen
who visited there told me every moment of the power of my charms, and this
only contributed to increase my melancholy, as I had thrown all their power
quite away. Thus each day I grew more pensive and he more insolent, till at
last the monster had the assurance to offer me to a young baronet of his
acquaintance. Need I describe, sir, how this ingratitude stung me? My
answer to this proposal was almost madness. I desired to part. As I was
going, he offered me a purse; but I flung it at him with indignation, and
burst from him in a rage that for a while kept me insensible of the miseries of
<a id='Page_110'></a>my situation. But I soon looked round me, and saw myself a vile, abject,
guilty thing, without one friend in the world to apply to. Just in that interval
a stage-coach happening to pass by, I took a place, it being my only aim to be
driven to a distance from a wretch I despised and detested. I was set down
here; where, since my arrival, my own anxiety, and this woman's unkindness,
have been my only companions. The hours of pleasure that I have passed
with my mamma and sister now grow painful to me. Their sorrows are much;
but mine are greater than theirs; for mine are mixed with guilt and infamy."</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'>The next morning I took my daughter behind me, and set out on my return
home. As we travelled along, I strove by every persuasion to calm her sorrows
and fears, and to arm her with resolution to bear the presence of her offended
mother. I took every opportunity, from the prospect of a fine country
through which we passed, to observe how much kinder Heaven was to us than
we to each other; and that the misfortunes of nature's making were but very
few. I assured her that she should never perceive any change in my affections,
and that during my life, which yet might be long, she might depend
upon a guardian and an instructor. I armed her against the censures of the
world, showed her that books were sweet unreproaching companions to the
miserable, and that, if they could not bring us to enjoy life, they would at least
teach us to endure it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hired horse that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn by the
way, within about five miles from my house; and as I was willing to prepare my
family for my daughter's reception, I determined to leave her that night at the
inn, and to return for her, accompanied by my daughter Sophia, early the next
morning. It was night before we reached our appointed stage; however, after
seeing her provided with a decent apartment, and having ordered the hostess
to prepare proper refreshments, I kissed her, and proceeded towards home.
And now my heart caught new sensations of pleasure, the nearer I approached
that peaceful mansion. As a bird that had been frightened from its nest,
my affections outwent my haste, and hovered round my little fireside with all
the rapture of expectation. I called up the many fond things I had to say,
and anticipated the welcome I was to receive. I already felt my wife's tender
embrace, and smiled at the joy of my little ones. As I walked but slowly, the
night waned apace; the labourers of the day were all retired to rest; the
<a id='Page_112'></a>lights were out in every cottage; no sounds were heard but of the shrilling
cock and the deep-mouthed watch-dog, at hollow distance. I approached my
little abode of pleasure, and, before I was within a furlong of the place, our
honest mastiff came running to welcome me.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now near midnight that I came to knock at my door: all was still
and silent—my heart dilated with unutterable happiness: when to my amazement,
I saw the house bursting out into a blaze of fire, and every aperture
red with conflagration! I gave a loud convulsive outcry, and fell upon the
pavement insensible. This alarmed my son, who had till this been asleep, and
he, perceiving the flames, instantly awakened my wife and daughter, and all
running out, naked and wild with apprehension, recalled me to life with their
anguish. But it was only to objects of new terror, for the flames had by this
time caught the roof of our dwelling, part after part continuing to fall in,
while the family stood with silent agony looking on as if they enjoyed the
blaze. I gazed upon them and upon it by turns, and then looked round me
for my two little ones; but they were not to be seen. "O misery! where,"
cried I, "where are my little ones?" "They are burnt to death in the
flames," said my wife, calmly, "and I will die with them." That moment I
heard the cry of the babes within, who were just awakened by the fire, and
nothing could have stopped me. "Where, where are my children?" cried I,
rushing through the flames, and bursting the door of the chamber in which
they were confined; "where are my little ones?" "Here, dear papa, here we
are!" cried they together, while the flames were just catching the bed where
they lay. I caught them both in my arms, and conveyed them through the
fire as fast as possible, while, just as I was going out, the roof sunk in.
"Now," cried I, holding up my children, "now let the flames burn on, and all
my possessions perish; here they are—I have saved my treasure: here, my
dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy." We kissed our
little darlings a thousand times; they clasped us round the neck, and seemed
to share our transports, while their mother laughed and wept by turns.</p>

<p class='c009'>I now stood a calm spectator of the flames, and after some time began to
perceive that my arm to the shoulder was scorched in a terrible manner. It
was, therefore, out of my power to give my son any assistance, either in
attempting to save our goods, or preventing the flames spreading to our corn.
By this time the neighbours were alarmed, and came running to our assistance;
but all they could do was to stand, like us, spectators of the calamity.
My goods, among which were the notes I had reserved for my daughters'
<a id='Page_113'></a>fortunes, were entirely consumed, except a box with some papers that stood in
the kitchen, and two or three things more of little consequence, which my son
brought away in the beginning. The neighbours contributed, however, what
they could to lighten our distress. They brought us clothes, and furnished
one of our outhouses with kitchen utensils; so that by daylight we had
another, though a wretched, dwelling to retire to. My honest next neighbour
and his children were not the least assiduous in providing us with everything
necessary, and offering whatever consolation untutored benevolence could
suggest.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the fears of my family had subsided, curiosity to know the cause of
my long stay began to take place; having, therefore, informed them of every
particular, I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our lost one; and,
though we had nothing but wretchedness now to impart, I was willing to procure
her a welcome to what we had. This task would have been more difficult
but for our own recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and
blunted it by more poignant afflictions. Being unable to go for my poor child
myself, as my arm grew very painful, I sent my son and daughter, who soon
returned, supporting the wretched delinquent, who had not the courage to look
up at her mother, whom no instructions of mine could persuade to a perfect
reconciliation; for women have a much stronger sense of female error than
men. "Ah, madam!" cried her mother, "this is but a poor place you are
come to after so much finery. My daughter Sophy and I can afford but little
entertainment to persons who have kept company only with people of distinction:
yes, Miss Livy, your poor father and I have suffered very much of
late; but I hope Heaven will forgive you." During this reception, the unhappy
victim stood pale and trembling, unable to weep or to reply; but I
could not continue a silent spectator of her distress; wherefore, assuming a
degree of severity in my voice and manner, which was ever followed with
instant submission, "I entreat, woman, that my words may be now marked
once for all: I have here brought you back a poor deluded wanderer—her
return to duty demands the revival of our tenderness. The real hardships of
life are now coming fast upon us; let us not, therefore, increase them by dissensions
among each other: if we live harmoniously together, we may yet be
contented, as there are enough of us to shut out the censuring world, and keep
each other in countenance. The kindness of Heaven is promised to the
penitent, and let ours be directed by the example. Heaven, we are assured,
is much more pleased to view a repentant sinner than ninety-nine persons who
<a id='Page_114'></a>have supported a course of undeviating rectitude: and this is right; for that
single effort by which we stop short in the down-hill path to perdition, is of
itself a greater exertion of virtue than a hundred acts of justice."</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'>Some assiduity was now required to make our present abode as convenient as
possible, and we were soon again qualified to enjoy our former serenity. Being
disabled myself from assisting my son in our usual occupations, I read to my
family from the few books that were saved, and particularly from such as, by
amusing the imagination, contributed to ease the heart. Our good neighbours,
too, came every day with the kindest condolence, and fixed a time in which
they were all to assist in repairing my former dwelling. Honest Farmer
Williams was not last among these visitors, but heartily offered his friendship.
He would even have renewed his addresses to my daughter; but she rejected
them in such a manner as totally repressed his future solicitations. Her grief
seemed formed for continuing, and she was the only person in our little society
that a week did not restore to cheerfulness. She now lost that unblushing innocence
which once taught her to respect herself, and to seek pleasure by pleasing.
Anxiety had now taken strong possession of her mind; her beauty began to
be impaired with her constitution, and neglect still more contributed to
diminish it. Every tender epithet bestowed on her sister brought a pang to
her heart and a tear to her eye; and as one vice, though cured, ever plants
others where it has been, so her former guilt, though driven out by repentance,
left jealousy and envy behind. I strove a thousand ways to lessen her
care, and even forgot my own pain in a concern for hers, collecting such
amusing passages of history as a strong memory and some reading could
suggest. "Our happiness, my dear," I would say, "is in the power of One
who can bring it about by a thousand unforeseen ways that mock our foresight.
If example be necessary to prove this, I'll give you a story, my child, told us
by a grave, though sometimes a romancing, historian.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Matilda was married very young to a Neapolitan nobleman of the first
quality, and found herself a widow and a mother at the age of fifteen. As
she stood one day caressing her infant son in the open window of an apartment
which hung over the river Volturna, the child, with a sudden spring,
leaped from her arms into the flood below, and disappeared in a moment.
The mother, struck with instant surprise, and making an effort to save him,
plunged in after; but, far from being able to assist the infant, she herself with
great difficulty escaped to the opposite shore, just when some French soldiers
<a id='Page_116'></a>were plundering the country on that side, who immediately made her their
prisoner.</p>

<p class='c009'>"As the war was then carried on between the French and Italians with the
utmost inhumanity, they were going at once to perpetrate those two extremes
suggested by appetite and cruelty. This base resolution, however, was
opposed by a young officer, who, though their retreat required the utmost
expedition, placed her behind him, and brought her in safety to his native city.
Her beauty at first caught his eye: her merit, soon after, his heart. They
were married; he rose to the highest posts; they lived long together, and
were happy. But the felicity of a soldier can never be called permanent:
after an interval of several years, the troops which he commanded having met
with a repulse, he was obliged to take shelter in the city where he had lived
with his wife. Here they suffered a siege, and the city at length was taken.
Few histories can produce more various instances of cruelty than those which
the French and Italians at that time exercised upon each other. It was
resolved by the victors, upon this occasion, to put all the French prisoners to
death; but particularly the husband of the unfortunate Matilda, as he
was principally instrumental in protracting the siege. Their determinations
were, in general, executed almost as soon as resolved upon. The captive
soldier was led forth, and the executioner with his sword stood ready, while
the spectators, in gloomy silence, awaited the fatal blow, which was only suspended
till the general, who presided as judge, should give the signal. It was
in this interval of anguish and expectation that Matilda came to take the last
farewell of her husband and deliverer, deploring her wretched situation, and
the cruelty of fate that had saved her from perishing by a premature death in
the river Volturna, to be the spectator of still greater calamities. The general,
who was a young man, was struck with surprise at her beauty and pity at her
distress; but with still stronger emotions when he heard her mention her
former dangers. He was her son, the infant for whom she had encountered
so much danger; he acknowledged her at once as his mother, and fell at her
feet. The rest may be easily supposed; the captive was set free, and all the
happiness that love, friendship, and duty could confer on earth, were united."</p>

<p class='c009'>In this manner I would attempt to amuse my daughter; but she listened
with divided attention; for her own misfortunes engrossed all the pity she
once had for those of another, and nothing gave her ease. In company she
dreaded contempt; and in solitude she only found anxiety. Such was the
colour of her wretchedness, when we received certain information that Mr.
<a id='Page_117'></a>Thornhill was going to be married to Miss Wilmot; for whom I always suspected
he had a real passion, though he took every opportunity before me to
express his contempt both of her person and fortune. This news served only
to increase poor Olivia's affliction; for such a flagrant breach of fidelity was
more than her courage could support. I was resolved, however, to get more
certain information; and to defeat, if possible, the completion of his designs,
by sending my son to old Mr. Wilmot's, with instructions to know the truth
of the report, and to deliver Miss Wilmot a letter intimating Mr. Thornhill's
conduct in my family. My son went, in pursuance of my directions, and in
three days returned, assuring us of the truth of the account; but that he had
found it impossible to deliver the letter, which he was therefore obliged to
leave, as Mr. Thornhill and Miss Wilmot were visiting round the country.
They were to be married, he said, in a few days, having appeared together at
church, the Sunday before he was there, in great splendour, the bride attended
by six young ladies, and he by as many gentlemen. Their approaching
nuptials filled the whole country with rejoicing, and they usually rode out
together in the grandest equipage that had been seen in the country for many
years. All the friends of both families, he said, were there, particularly the
squire's uncle, Sir William Thornhill, who bore so good a character. He
added, that nothing but mirth and feasting were going forward; that all the
country praised the young bride's beauty and the bridegroom's fine person,
and that they were immensely fond of each other; concluding that he could
not help thinking Mr. Thornhill one of the most happy men in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Why, let him if he can," returned I; "but, my son, observe this bed of
straw and unsheltering roof; those mouldering walls and humid floor; my
wretched body thus disabled by fire, and my children weeping round me for
bread: you have come home, my child, to all this; yet here, even here, you
see a man that would not for a thousand worlds exchange situations. Oh, my
children, if you could but learn to commune with your own hearts, and know
what noble company you can make them, you would little regard the elegance
and splendour of the worthless. Almost all men have been taught to call life
a passage, and themselves the travellers. The similitude still may be improved,
when we observe that the good are joyful and serene, like travellers that are
going towards home; the wicked but by intervals happy, like travellers that
are going into exile."</p>

<p class='c009'>My compassion for my poor daughter, overpowered by this new disaster,
interrupted what I had further to observe. I bade her mother support her,
<a id='Page_118'></a>and after a short time she recovered. She appeared from that time more calm,
and I imagined had gained a new degree of resolution; but appearances
deceived me; for her tranquillity was the languor of overwrought resentment.
A supply of provisions, charitably sent us by my kind parishioners, seemed to
diffuse new cheerfulness among the rest of my family, nor was I displeased at
seeing them once more sprightly and at ease. It would have been unjust to
damp their satisfaction, merely to condole with resolute melancholy, or to
burden them with a sadness they did not feel. Thus, once more, the tale went
round, and a song was demanded, and cheerfulness condescended to hover
round our little habitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next morning the sun arose with peculiar warmth for the season, so that
we agreed to breakfast together on the honeysuckle bank; where, while we
sat, my youngest daughter, at my request, joined her voice to the concert on
the trees about us. It was in this place my poor Olivia first met her seducer,
and every object served to recall her sadness. But that melancholy which is
excited by objects of pleasure, or inspired by sounds of harmony, soothes the
heart instead of corroding it. Her mother, too, upon this occasion felt a
pleasing distress, and wept, and loved her daughter as before. "Do, my
pretty Olivia," cried she, "let us have that little melancholy air your papa
was so fond of; your sister Sophy has already obliged us. Do, child; it will
please your old father." She complied in a manner so exquisitely pathetic, as
moved me.</p>

<p class='c009'>As she was concluding the last stanza, to which an interruption in her
voice, from sorrow, gave peculiar softness, the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's
equipage at a distance alarmed us all, but particularly increased the uneasiness
of my eldest daughter, who, desirous of shunning her betrayer, returned
to the house with her sister. In a few minutes he was alighted from his
chariot, and, making up to the place where I was still sitting, inquired after
my health with his usual air of familiarity. "Sir," replied I, "your present
assurance only serves to aggravate the baseness of your character; and there
was a time when I would have chastised your insolence for presuming thus to
appear before me. But now you are safe; for age has cooled my passions,
and my calling restrains them."</p>

<p class='c009'>"I vow, my dear sir," returned he, "I am amazed at all this; nor can I
understand what it means! I hope you do not think your daughter's late
excursion with me had anything criminal in it."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Go," cried I, "thou art a wretch, a poor pitiful wretch, and every way a
liar; but your meanness secures you from my anger. Yet, sir, I am descended
<a id='Page_120'></a>from a family that would not have borne this! And so, thou vile
thing! to gratify a momentary passion thou hast made one poor creature
wretched for life, and polluted a family that had nothing but honour for their
portion."</p>

<p class='c009'>"If she, or you," returned he, "are resolved to be miserable, I cannot help
it. But you may still be happy; and whatever opinion you may have formed
of me, you shall ever find me ready to contribute to it. We can marry her to
another in a short time; and, what is more, she may keep her lover beside;
for I protest I shall ever continue to have a true regard for her."</p>

<p class='c009'>I found all my passions alarmed at this new degrading proposal; for
though the mind may often be calm under great injuries, little villainy can at
any time get within the soul, and sting it into rage. "Avoid my sight, thou
reptile!" cried I, "nor continue to insult me with thy presence. Were my
brave son at home, he would not suffer this; but I am old and disabled, and
every way undone."</p>

<p class='c009'>"I find," cried he, "you are bent upon obliging me to talk in a harsher
manner than I intended. But, as I have shown you what may be hoped from
my friendship, it may not be improper to represent what may be the consequences
of my resentment. My attorney, to whom your late bond has been
transferred, threatens hard; nor do I know how to prevent the course of
justice, except by paying the money myself; which as I have been at some
expenses lately, previous to my intended marriage, is not so easy to be done.
And then my steward talks of driving for the rent: it is certain he knows his
duty; for I never trouble myself with affairs of that nature. Yet still I could
wish to serve you, and even to have you and your daughter present at my
marriage, which is shortly to be solemnised, with Miss Wilmot; it is even the
request of my charming Arabella herself, whom I hope you will not refuse."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Mr. Thornhill," replied I, "hear me once for all: as to your marriage
with any but my daughter, that I never will consent to; and though your
friendship could raise me to a throne, or your resentment sink me to the grave,
yet would I despise both. Thou hast once woefully, irreparably deceived me.
I reposed my heart upon thine honour, and have found it baseness. Never
more, therefore, expect friendship from me. Go, and possess what fortune has
given thee—beauty, riches, health, and pleasure. Go, and leave me to want,
infamy, disease, and sorrow. Yet, humbled as I am, shall my heart still vindicate
its dignity; and though thou hast my forgiveness, thou shalt ever have
my contempt."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_121'></a>"If so," returned he, "depend upon it you shall feel the effects of this
insolence, and we shall shortly see which is the fittest object of scorn, you or
me." Upon which he departed abruptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>My wife and son, who were present at this interview, seemed terrified with
apprehension. My daughters also, finding that he was gone, came out to be
informed of the result of our conference; which, when known, alarmed them
not less than the rest. But as to myself, I disregarded the utmost stretch of
his malevolence—he had already struck the blow, and I now stood prepared
to repel every new effort, like one of those instruments used in the act of
war, which, however thrown, still present a point to receive the enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>We soon, however, found that he had not threatened in vain; for the very
next morning his steward came to demand my annual rent, which, by the train
of accidents already related, I was unable to pay. The consequence of my
incapacity was, his driving my cattle that evening, and their being appraised
and sold the next day for less than half their value. My wife and children
now, therefore, entreated me to comply upon any terms, rather than incur
certain destruction. They even begged of me to admit his visits once more,
and used all their little eloquence to paint the calamities I was going to endure—the
terrors of a prison in so rigorous a season as the present, with the
danger that threatened my health from the late accident that happened by
the fire. But I continued inflexible.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Why, my treasures," cried I, "why will you thus attempt to persuade
me to the thing that is not right? My duty has taught me to forgive him,
but my conscience will not permit me to approve. Would you have me
applaud to the world what my heart must internally condemn? Would you
have me tamely sit down and flatter our infamous betrayer; and, to avoid a
prison, continually suffer the more galling bonds of mental confinement? No,
never! If we are to be taken from this abode, only let us hold to the right,
and, wherever we are thrown, we can still retire to a charming apartment,
where we can look round our own hearts with intrepidity and with pleasure."</p>

<p class='c009'>In this manner we spent that evening. Early the next morning, as the
snow had fallen in great abundance in the night, my son was employed in
clearing it away, and opening a passage before the door. He had not been
thus engaged long, when he came running in, with looks all pale, to tell
us that two strangers, whom he knew to be officers of justice, were making
towards the house.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Just as he spoke they came in, and approaching the bed where I lay, after
previously informing me of their employment and business, made me their
prisoner, bidding me prepare to go with them to the county gaol, which was
eleven miles off.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_123'></a>"My friends," said I, "this is severe weather in which you are come to
take me to a prison; and it is particularly unfortunate at this time, as one of
my arms has lately been burnt in a terrible manner, and it has thrown me
into a slight fever, and I want clothes to cover me; and I am now too weak
and old to walk far in such deep snow; but if it must be so——"</p>

<p class='c009'>I then turned to my wife and children, and directed them to get together
what few things were left us, and to prepare immediately for leaving this
place. I entreated them to be expeditious; and desired my son to assist his
eldest sister, who, from a consciousness that she was the cause of all our
calamities, was fallen, and had lost anguish in insensibility. I encouraged my
wife, who, pale and trembling, clasped our affrighted little ones in her arms,
that clung to her bosom in silence, dreading to look round at the strangers.
In the meantime my youngest daughter prepared for our departure, and as
she received several hints to use despatch, in about an hour we were ready to
depart.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XXV.</i><br /> <br /><i>No situation, however wretched it seems,<br />but has some sort of comfort attending it.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>We set forward from this peaceful neighbourhood, and walked on slowly. My
eldest daughter being enfeebled by a slow fever, which had begun for some
days to undermine her constitution, one of the officers who had a horse kindly
took her behind him; for even these men cannot entirely divest themselves
of humanity. My son led one of the little ones by the hand, and my wife the
other; while I leaned upon my youngest girl, whose tears fell not for her own
but my distresses.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were now got from my late dwelling about two miles, when we saw a
crowd running and shouting behind us, consisting of about fifty of my poorest
parishioners. These, with dreadful imprecations, soon seized upon the two
officers of justice, and swearing they would never see their minister go to
a gaol while they had a drop of blood to shed in his defence, were going to
use them with great severity. The consequence might have been fatal had
<a id='Page_124'></a>I not immediately interposed, and with some difficulty rescued the officers
from the hands of the enraged multitude. My children, who looked upon my
delivery now as certain, appeared transported with joy, and were incapable of
containing their raptures. But they were soon undeceived upon hearing
me address the poor deluded people, who came, as they imagined, to do me
service.</p>

<p class='c009'>"What! my friends," cried, I, "and is this the way you love me? Is this
the manner you obey the instructions I have given you from the pulpit? thus
to fly in the face of justice, and bring down ruin on yourselves and me?
Which is your ringleader? Show me the man that has thus seduced you.
As sure as he lives he shall feel my resentment. Alas! my dear deluded flock,
return back to the duty you owe to God, to your country, and to me. I shall
yet, perhaps, one day see you in greater felicity here, and contribute to make
your lives more happy. But let it at least be my comfort, when I pen my fold
for immortality, that not one here shall be wanting."</p>

<p class='c009'>They now seemed all repentance, and melting into tears, came, one after
the other, to bid me farewell. I shook each tenderly by the hand, and leaving
them my blessing, proceeded forward without meeting any further interruption.
Some hours before night we reached the town, or rather village, for it consisted
but of a few mean houses, having lost all its former opulence, and retaining
no marks of its ancient superiority but the gaol.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon entering we put up at an inn, where we had such refreshments as
could most readily be procured, and I supped with my family with my usual
cheerfulness. After seeing them properly accommodated for that night, I next
attended the sheriff's officers to the prison, which had formerly been built for
the purposes of war, and consisted of one large apartment, strongly grated,
and paved with stone, common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in
the four-and-twenty. Besides this, every prisoner had a separate cell, where
he was locked in for the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>I expected upon my entrance to find nothing but lamentations and
various sounds of misery; but it was very different. The prisoners seemed all
employed in one common design, that of forgetting thought in merriment
or clamour. I was apprised of the usual perquisite required upon these occasions;
and immediately complied with the demand, though the little money
I had was very near being all exhausted. This was immediately sent away
for liquor, and the whole prison was soon filled with riot, laughter, and profaneness.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_125'></a>"How!" cried I to myself, "shall men so very wicked be cheerful, and
shall I be melancholy? I feel only the same confinement with them, and I
think I have more reason to be happy."</p>

<p class='c009'>With such reflections I laboured to become more cheerful: but cheerfulness
was never yet produced by effort, which is itself painful. As I was sitting,
therefore, in a corner of the gaol, in a pensive posture, one of my fellow-prisoners
came up, and sitting by me, entered into conversation. It was my constant
rule in life never to avoid the conversation of any man who seemed to desire
it; for if good, I might profit by his instructions; if bad, he might be assisted
by mine. I found this to be a knowing man, of strong unlettered sense, but
a thorough knowledge of the world, as it is called; or, more properly speaking,
of human nature on the wrong side. He asked me if I had taken care
to provide myself with a bed, which was a circumstance I had never once
attended to.</p>

<p class='c009'>"That's unfortunate," cried he, "as you are allowed nothing but straw,
and your apartment is very large and cold. However, you seem to be something
of a gentleman, and as I have been one myself in my time, part of my
bed-clothes are heartily at your service."</p>

<p class='c009'>I thanked him, professing my surprise at finding such humanity in a gaol
in misfortunes; adding, to let him see that I was a scholar, "that the sage
ancient seemed to understand the value of company in affliction, when he said,
<i>ton kosmon aire, ei dos ton etairon</i>; and, in fact," continued I, "what is the
world if it affords only solitude?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"You talk of the world, sir," returned my fellow-prisoner: "the world is
in its dotage, and yet the cosmogony, or creation of the world, has puzzled
the philosophers of every age. What a medley of opinions have they not
broached upon the creation of the world! Sanchoniathon, Manetho, Berosus,
and Ocellus Lucanus, have all attempted it in vain. The latter has these
words: <i>Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan</i>, which implies—" "I ask pardon,
sir," cried I, "for interrupting so much learning; but I think I have heard
all this before. Have I not had the pleasure of once seeing you at Welbridge
fair, and is not your name Ephraim Jenkinson?" At this demand he only
sighed. "I suppose you must recollect," resumed I, "one Doctor Primrose,
from whom you bought a horse?"</p>

<p class='c009'>He now at once recollected me, for the gloominess of the place and the
approaching night prevented his distinguishing my features before. "Yes,
sir," returned Mr. Jenkinson, "I remember you perfectly well; I bought a
<a id='Page_126'></a>horse, but forgot to pay for him. Your neighbour Flamborough is the only
prosecutor I am any way afraid of at the next assizes; for he intends to swear
positively against me as a coiner. I am heartily sorry, sir, I ever deceived
you, or indeed any man: for you see," continued he, pointing to his shackles,
"what my tricks have brought me to."</p>

<p>"<i>The execrations, lewdness, and brutality<br />that invaded me on every side, drove me back<br />to my apartment again.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 127.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>"Well, sir," replied I, "your kindness in offering me assistance, when you
could expect no return, shall be repaid with my endeavours to soften or totally
suppress Mr. Flamborough's evidence, and I will send my son to him for that
purpose the first opportunity: nor do I in the least doubt but he will comply
<a id='Page_127'></a>with my request: and as to my own evidence, you need be under no uneasiness
about that."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Well, sir," cried he, "all the return I can make shall be yours. You shall
have more than half my bed-clothes to-night, and I'll take care to stand your
friend in the prison, where I think I have some influence."</p>

<p class='c009'>I thanked him, and could not avoid being surprised at the present youthful
change in his aspect; for at the time I had seen him before he appeared at
least sixty. "Sir," answered he, "you are little acquainted with the world.
I had at that time false hair, and have learned the art of counterfeiting every
age from seventeen to seventy. Ah, sir! had I but bestowed half the pains in
learning a trade that I have in learning to be a scoundrel, I might have been
a rich man at this day. But, rogue as I am, still I may be your friend, and
that, perhaps, when you least expect it."</p>

<p class='c009'>We were now prevented from further conversation by the arrival of the
gaoler's servants, who came to call over the prisoners' names, and lock up for
the night. A fellow also with a bundle of straw for my bed attended, who led
me along a dark narrow passage into a room paved like the common prison,
and in one corner of this I spread my bed, and the clothes given me by my
fellow-prisoner; which done, my conductor, who was civil enough, bade me
a good night. After my usual meditations, and having praised my Heavenly
Corrector, I laid myself down, and slept with the utmost tranquillity until
morning.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XXVI.</i><br /> <br /><i>A reformation in the gaol.—To make laws complete,<br />they should reward as well as punish.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The next morning early I was awakened by my family, whom I found in tears
at my bedside. The gloomy appearance of everything about us, it seems,
had daunted them. I gently rebuked their sorrow, assuring them I had never
slept with greater tranquillity, and next inquired after my eldest daughter,
who was not among them. They informed me that yesterday's uneasiness and
fatigue had increased her fever, and it was judged proper to leave her behind.
<a id='Page_128'></a>My next care was to send my son to procure a room or two to lodge my family
in, as near the prison as conveniently could be found. He obeyed, but could
only find one apartment, which was hired at a small expense for his mother
and sisters, the gaoler with humanity consenting to let him and his two little
brothers lie in the prison with me. A bed was therefore prepared for them in
a corner of the room, which I thought answered very conveniently. I was
willing, however, previously to know whether my little children chose to lie in
a place which seemed to fright them upon entrance.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Well," cried I, "my good boys, how do you like your bed? I hope
you are not afraid to lie in this room, dark as it appears."</p>

<p class='c009'>"No, papa," says Dick, "I am not afraid to lie anywhere where you are."</p>

<p class='c009'>"And I," says Bill, who was yet but four years old, "love every place best
that my papa is in."</p>

<p class='c009'>After this I allotted to each of the family what they were to do. My
daughter was particularly directed to watch her sister's declining health; my
wife was to attend me; my little boys were to read to me. "And as for you,
my son," continued I, "it is by the labour of your hands we must all hope to
be supported. Your wages as a day-labourer will be fully sufficient, with
proper frugality, to maintain us all, and comfortably too. Thou art now sixteen
years old, and hast strength, and it was given thee, my son, for very
useful purposes; for it must save from famine your helpless parents and family.
Prepare then this evening to look out for work against to-morrow, and bring
home every night what money you earn for our support."</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus instructed him, and settled the rest, I walked down to the
common prison, where I could enjoy more air and room. But I was not long
there when the execrations, lewdness, and brutality that invaded me on every
side, drove me back to my apartment again. Here I sat for some time
pondering upon the strange infatuation of wretches who, finding all mankind
in open arms against them, were labouring to make themselves a future and
a tremendous enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their insensibility excited my highest compassion, and blotted my own
uneasiness from my mind. It even appeared a duty incumbent upon me to
attempt to reclaim them. I resolved, therefore, once more to return, and, in
spite of their contempt, to give them my advice, and conquer them by perseverance.
Going therefore among them again, I informed Mr. Jenkinson of my
design, at which he laughed heartily, but communicated it to the rest. The
proposal was received with the greatest good humour, as it promised to afford
<a id='Page_129'></a>a new fund of entertainment to persons who had now no other resource for
mirth but what could be derived from ridicule or debauchery.</p>

<p class='c009'>I therefore read them a portion of the service, with a loud, unaffected voice,
and found my audience perfectly merry upon the occasion. Lewd whispers,
groans of contrition burlesqued, winking, and coughing, alternately excited
laughter. However, I continued with my natural solemnity to read on, sensible
that what I did might amend some, but could itself receive no contamination
from any.</p>

<p class='c009'>After reading, I entered upon my exhortation, which was rather calculated
at first to amuse them than to reprove. I previously observed that no other
motive but their welfare could induce me to this; that I was their fellow-prisoner,
and now got nothing by preaching. I was sorry, I said, to hear them
so very profane; because they got nothing by it, and might lose a great deal.
"For be assured, my friends," cried I, ("for you are my friends, however the
world may disclaim your friendship,) though you swore twelve thousand oaths
in a day, it would not put one penny in your purse. Then what signifies
calling every moment upon the devil, and courting his friendship, since you
find how scurvily he uses you? He has given you nothing here, you find, but
a mouthful of oaths and an empty belly; and, by the best accounts I have of
him, he will give you nothing that's good hereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>"If used ill in our dealings with one man, we naturally go elsewhere.
Were it not worth your while, then, just to try how you may like the usage
of another Master, who gives you fair promises, at least, to come to Him?
Surely, my friends, of all stupidity in the world, his must be the greatest, who,
after robbing a house, runs to the thief-takers for protection. And yet how
are you more wise? You are all seeking comfort from one that has already
betrayed you, applying to a more malicious being than any thief-taker of them
all; for they only decoy and then hang you; but he decoys and hangs, and,
what is worst of all, will not let you loose after the hangman has done."</p>

<p class='c009'>When I had concluded, I received the compliments of my audience, some
of whom came and shook me by the hand, swearing that I was a very honest
fellow, and that they desired my further acquaintance. I therefore promised
to repeat my lecture next day, and actually conceived some hope of making a
reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the
hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the
archer could but take a proper aim. When I had thus satisfied my mind, I
went back to my apartment, where my wife prepared a frugal meal, while Mr.
Jenkinson begged leave to add his dinner to ours, and partake of the pleasure,
as he was kind enough to express it, of my conversation. He had not yet seen
my family, for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow passage
already described, by this means they avoided the common prison. Jenkinson
at the first interview, therefore, seemed not a little struck with the beauty of
my youngest daughter, which her pensive air contributed to heighten, and my
little ones did not pass unnoticed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_131'></a>"Alas! doctor," cried he, "these children are too handsome and too good
for such a place as this."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Why, Mr. Jenkinson," replied I, "thank Heaven, my children are pretty
tolerable in morals; and if they be good, it matters little for the rest."</p>

<p class='c009'>"I fancy, sir," returned my fellow-prisoner, "that it must give you a great
comfort to have all this little family about you."</p>

<p class='c009'>"A comfort, Mr. Jenkinson!" replied I, "yes, it is indeed a comfort, and
I would not be without them for all the world; for they can make a dungeon
seem a palace. There is but one way in this life of wounding my happiness,
and that is by injuring them."</p>

<p class='c009'>"I am afraid then, sir," cried he, "that I am in some measure culpable;
for I think I see here (looking at my son Moses) one that I have injured, and
by whom I wish to be forgiven."</p>

<p class='c009'>My son immediately recollected his voice and features, though he had
before seen him in disguise, and taking him by the hand, with a smile forgave
him. "Yet," continued he, "I can't help wondering at what you could see
in my face to think me a proper mark for deception."</p>

<p class='c009'>"My dear sir," returned the other, "it was not your face, but your white
stockings and the black riband in your hair, that allured me. But, no disparagement
to your parts, I have deceived wiser men than you in my time;
and yet with all my tricks the blockheads have been too many for me at last."</p>

<p class='c009'>"I suppose," cried my son, "that the narrative of such a life as yours
must be extremely instructive and amusing."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Not much of either," returned Mr. Jenkinson. "Those relations which
describe the tricks and vices only of mankind, by increasing our suspicion in
life, retard our success. The traveller that distrusts every person he meets,
and turns back upon the appearance of every man that looks like a robber,
seldom arrives in time at his journey's end.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Indeed, I think, from my own experience, that the knowing one is the
silliest fellow under the sun. I was thought cunning from my very childhood;
when but seven years old the ladies would say that I was a perfect little man;
at fourteen I knew the world, cocked my hat, and loved the ladies; at twenty,
<a id='Page_132'></a>though I was perfectly honest, yet every one thought me so cunning, that no
one would trust me. Thus, I was at last obliged to turn sharper in my own
defence, and have lived ever since, my head throbbing with schemes to deceive,
and my heart palpitating with fears of detection. I used often to laugh at
your honest simple neighbour Flamborough, and one way or another generally
cheated him once a year. Yet still the honest man went forward without
suspicion, and grew rich, while I still continued tricksy and cunning, and
was poor without the consolation of being honest. However," continued he,
"let me know your case, and what has brought you here; perhaps, though I
have not skill to avoid a gaol myself, I may extricate my friends."</p>

<p class='c009'>In compliance with his curiosity, I informed him of the whole train of
accidents and follies that had plunged me into my present troubles, and my
utter inability to get free.</p>

<p class='c009'>After hearing my story, and pausing some minutes, he slapped his forehead,
as if he had hit upon something material, and took his leave, saying he
would try what could be done.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XXVII.</i><br /> <br /><i>The same subject continued.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The next morning I communicated to my wife and children the schemes I had
planned of reforming the prisoners, which they received with universal disapprobation,
alleging the impossibility and impropriety of it; adding that my
endeavours would no way contribute to their amendment, but might probably
disgrace my calling.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Excuse me," returned I, "these people, however fallen, are still men;
and that is a very good title to my affections. Good counsel rejected returns
to enrich the giver's bosom; and though the instruction I communicate may
not mend them, yet it will assuredly mend myself. If these wretches, my
children, were princes, there would be thousands ready to offer their ministry;
but in my opinion, the heart that is buried in a dungeon is as precious as that
seated upon a throne. Yes, my treasures, if I can mend them, I will; perhaps
they will not all despise me: perhaps I may catch up even one from the gulf,
<a id='Page_133'></a>and that will be great gain; for is there upon earth a gem so precious as the
human soul?"</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus saying, I left them and descended to the common prison, where I
found the prisoners very merry, expecting my arrival; and each prepared with
some gaol-trick to play upon the doctor. Thus, as I was going to begin, one
turned my wig awry, as if by accident, and then asked my pardon. A second,
who stood at some distance, had a knack of spitting through his teeth, which
fell in showers upon my book. A third would cry "Amen!" in such an
affected tone as gave the rest great delight. A fourth had slily picked my
pocket of my spectacles. But there was one whose trick gave more universal
pleasure than all the rest; for observing the manner in which I had
disposed my books on the table before me, he very dexterously displaced one
of them, and put an obscene jest-book of his own in the place. However, I
took no notice of all that this mischievous group of little beings could do, but
went on, perfectly sensible that what was ridiculous in my attempt would excite
mirth only the first or second time, while what was serious would be permanent.
My design succeeded, and in less than six days some were penitent, and
all were attentive.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now that I applauded my perseverance and address at thus giving
sensibility to wretches divested of every moral feeling, and now began to think
of doing them temporal services also, by rendering their situation somewhat
more comfortable. Their time had hitherto been divided between famine
and excess, tumultuous riot and bitter repining. Their only employment was
quarrelling among each other, playing at cribbage, and cutting tobacco-stoppers.
From this last mode of idle industry I took the hint of setting such as chose to
work at cutting pegs for tobacconists and shoemakers, the proper wood being
bought by a general subscription, and, when manufactured, sold by my appointment;
so that each earned something every day: a trifle, indeed, but sufficient
to maintain him.</p>

<p class='c009'>I did not stop here, but instituted fines for the punishment of immorality,
and rewards for peculiar industry. Thus in less than a fortnight I had formed
them into something social and humane, and had the pleasure of regarding
myself as a legislator, who had brought men from their native ferocity into
friendship and obedience.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Olivia and Sophia leaving the Prison.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>And it were highly to be wished, that legislative power would thus direct
the law rather to reformation than severity; that it would seem convinced that
the work of eradicating crimes is not by making punishments familiar, but
formidable. Then, instead of our present prisons, which find or make men
guilty, which enclose wretches for the commission of one crime, and return
them, if returned alive, fitted for the perpetration of thousands, we should see,
as in other parts of Europe, places of penitence and solitude, where the accused
might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty, or new
motives to virtue if innocent. And this, but not the increasing punishments,
is the way to mend a state: nor can I avoid even questioning the validity of
that right which social combinations have assumed of capitally punishing
offences of a slight nature. In cases of murder their right is obvious, as it is
the duty of us all, from the law of self-defence, to cut off that man who has
<a id='Page_135'></a>shown a disregard for the life of another. Against such, all nature rises in
arms; but it is not so against him who steals my property. Natural law gives
me no right to take away his life, as by that the horse he steals is as much his
property as mine. If, then, I have any right, it must be from a compact made
between us, that he who deprives the other of his horse shall die. But this is
a false compact; because no man has a right to barter his life any more than
to take it away, as it is not his own. And besides, the compact is inadequate,
and would be set aside even in a court of modern equity, as there is a great
penalty for a trifling inconvenience, since it is far better that two men should
live than that one man should ride. But a compact that is false between two
men is equally so between a hundred and a hundred thousand; for as ten
millions of circles can never make a square, so the united voice of myriads
cannot lend the smallest foundation to falsehood. It is thus that reason
speaks, and untutored nature says the same thing. Savages that are directed
by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other; they seldom
shed blood but to retaliate former cruelty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our Saxon ancestors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions
in times of peace; and in all commencing governments, that have the print
of nature still strong upon them, scarcely any crime is held capital.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is among the citizens of a refined community that penal laws, which
are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it
grows older, seems to acquire the moroseness of age; and as if our property
were become dearer in proportion as it increased—as if the more enormous
our wealth, the more extensive our fears—all our possessions are paled up with
new edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to scare every invader.</p>

<p class='c009'>I cannot tell whether it is from the number of our penal laws, or the
licentiousness of our people, that this country should show more convicts in
a year than half the dominions of Europe united. Perhaps it is owing to
both; for they mutually produce each other. When by indiscriminate penal
laws a nation beholds the same punishment affixed to dissimilar degrees of
guilt, from perceiving no distinction in the penalty, the people are led to lose
all sense of distinction in the crime, and this distinction is the bulwark of all
morality. Thus the multitude of laws produce new vices, and new vices call
for fresh restraints.</p>

<p class='c009'>It were to be wished, then, that power, instead of contriving new laws to
punish vice, instead of drawing hard the cords of society till a convulsion come
to burst them, instead of cutting away wretches as useless before we have tried
<a id='Page_136'></a>their utility, instead of converting correction into vengeance—it were to be
wished that we tried the restrictive arts of government, and made law the
protector, but not the tyrant, of the people. We should then find that
creatures whose souls are held as dross, only wanted the hand of a refiner; we
should then find that wretches, now stuck up for long tortures, lest luxury
should feel a momentary pang, might, if properly treated, serve to sinew the
state in times of danger; that as their faces are like ours, their hearts are so
too; that few minds are so base as that perseverance cannot amend; that a
man may see his last crime without dying for it; and that very little blood
will serve to cement our security.</p>

<p class='c008'>I had now been confined more than a fortnight, but had not since my arrival
been visited by my dear Olivia, and I greatly longed to see her. Having communicated
my wishes to my wife, the next morning the poor girl entered my
apartment leaning on her sister's arm. The change which I saw in her countenance
struck me. The numberless graces that once resided there were now
fled, and the hand of death seemed to have moulded every feature to alarm
me. Her temples were sunk, her forehead was tense, and a fatal paleness sat
upon her cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>"I am glad to see thee, my dear," cried I; "but why this dejection, Livy?
I hope, my love, you have too great a regard for me to permit disappointment
thus to undermine a life which I prize as my own. Be cheerful, child, and
we may yet see happier days"</p>

<p class='c009'>"You have ever, sir," replied she, "been kind to me, and it adds to my
pain that I shall never have an opportunity of sharing that happiness you
promise. Happiness, I fear, is no longer reserved for me here, and I long
to be rid of a place where I have only found distress. Indeed, sir, I wish you
<a id='Page_137'></a>would make a proper submission to Mr. Thornhill: it may in some measure
induce him to pity you, and it will give me relief in dying."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Never, child!" replied I, "never will I be brought to acknowledge my
daughter a prostitute; for though the world may look upon your offence with
scorn, let it be mine to regard it as a mark of credulity, not of guilt. My
dear, I am no way miserable in this place, however dismal it may seem; and
be assured that, while you continue to bless me by living, he shall never have
my consent to make you more wretched by marrying another."</p>

<p class='c009'>After the departure of my daughter, my fellow-prisoner, who was by at this
interview, sensibly enough expostulated upon my obstinacy in refusing a
submission which promised to give me freedom. He observed that the rest
of my family were not to be sacrificed to the peace of one child alone, and she
the only one who had offended me. "Besides," added he, "I don't know if it
be just thus to obstruct the union of man and wife, which you do at present,
by refusing to consent to a match which you cannot hinder, but may render
unhappy."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Sir," replied I, "you are unacquainted with the man that oppresses us.
I am very sensible that no submission I can make could procure me liberty
even for an hour. I am told that even in this very room a debtor of his, no
later than last year, died for want. But though my submission and approbation
could transfer me from hence to the most beautiful apartment he is
possessed of, yet I would grant neither, as something whispers me that it
would be giving a sanction to adultery. While my daughter lives, no other
marriage of his shall ever be legal in my eye. Were she removed, indeed, I
should be the basest of men, from any resentment of my own, to attempt
putting asunder those who wish for a union. No; villain as he is, I should
then wish him married, to prevent the consequences of his future debaucheries.
But now should I not be the most cruel of all fathers to sign an instrument
which must send my child to the grave, merely to avoid a prison myself; and
thus, to escape one pang, break my child's heart with a thousand?"</p>

<p class='c009'>He acquiesced in the justice of this answer, but could not avoid observing
that he feared my daughter's life was already too much wasted to keep me
long a prisoner. "However," continued he, "though you refuse to submit to
the nephew, I hope you have no objection to laying your case before the uncle,
who has the first character in the kingdom for everything that is just and good.
I would advise you to send him a letter by the post, intimating all his nephew's
ill-usage, and, my life for it, that in three days you shall have an answer." I
<a id='Page_138'></a>thanked him for the hint, and instantly set about complying; but I wanted
paper, and, unluckily, all our money had been laid out that morning in
provisions: however, he supplied me.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i_157.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>"<i>My children, however, sat by me, and, while<br />I was stretched on my straw, read to me by turns,<br />or listened and wept at my instructions.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 137.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>For the three ensuing days I was in a state of anxiety to know what reception
my letter might meet with; but in the meantime was frequently solicited
by my wife to submit to any conditions rather than remain here, and every
hour received repeated accounts of the decline of my daughter's health. The
third day and the fourth arrived, but I received no answer to my letter: the
complaints of a stranger against a favourite nephew were no way likely to
succeed; so that these hopes soon vanished like all my former. My mind,
however, still supported itself, though confinement and bad air began to
make a visible alteration in my health, and my arm that had suffered in the
fire grew worse. My children, however, sat by me, and, while I was stretched
on my straw, read to me by turns, or listened and wept at my instructions.
<a id='Page_139'></a>But my daughter's health declined faster than mine; every message from her
contributed to increase my apprehensions and pain. The fifth morning after I
had written the letter which was sent to Sir William Thornhill, I was alarmed
with an account that she was speechless. Now it was that confinement was
truly painful to me; my soul was bursting from its prison to be near the pillow
of my child, to comfort, to strengthen her, to receive her last wishes, and teach
her soul the way to heaven! Another account came—she was expiring, and
yet I was debarred the small comfort of weeping by her. My fellow-prisoner,
some time after, came with the last account. He bade me be patient—she
was dead! The next morning he returned, and found me with my two little
ones, now my only companions, who were using all their innocent efforts to
comfort me. They entreated to read to me, and bade me not to cry, for I was
now too old to weep. "And is not my sister an angel now, papa?" cried the
eldest, "and why then are you sorry for her? I wish I were an angel, out of
this frightful place, if my papa were with me." "Yes," added my youngest
darling, "heaven, where my sister is, is a finer place than this, and there are
none but good people there, and the people here are very bad."</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Jenkinson interrupted their harmless prattle, by observing that, now
my daughter was no more, I should seriously think of the rest of my family,
and attempt to save my own life, which was every day declining for want of
necessaries and wholesome air. He added that it was now incumbent on me
to sacrifice any pride or resentment of my own to the welfare of those who
depended on me for support; and that I was now, both by reason and justice,
obliged to try to reconcile my landlord.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Heaven be praised!" replied I, "there is no pride left me now. I
should detest my own heart if I saw either pride or resentment lurking there.
On the contrary, as my oppressor has been once my parishioner, I hope one
day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal. No, sir, I
have no resentment now; and though he has taken from me what I held
dearer than all his treasures, though he has wrung my heart—for I am sick
almost to fainting, very sick, my fellow-prisoner—yet that shall never inspire
me with vengeance. I am now willing to approve his marriage; and if this
submission can do him any pleasure, let him know that if I have done him any
injury I am sorry for it." Mr. Jenkinson took pen and ink, and wrote down
my submission nearly as I have expressed it, to which I signed my name.
My son was employed to carry the letter to Mr. Thornhill, who was then at his
seat in the country. He went, and in about six hours returned with a verbal
<a id='Page_140'></a>answer. He had some difficulty, he said, to get a sight of his landlord, as the
servants were insolent and suspicious; but he accidentally saw him as he
was going out upon business, preparing for his marriage, which was to be in
three days. He continued to inform us that he stepped up in the humblest
manner, and delivered the letter, which, when Mr. Thornhill had read, he said
that all submission was now too late and unnecessary; that he had heard of
our application to his uncle, which met with the contempt it deserved; and,
as for the rest, that all future applications should be directed to his attorney,
not to him. He observed, however, that as he had a very good opinion of the
discretion of the two young ladies, they might have been the most agreeable
intercessors.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Well, sir," said I to my fellow-prisoner, "you now discover the temper
of the man that oppresses me. He can at once be facetious and cruel; but
let him use me as he will, I shall soon be free, in spite of all his bolts to
restrain me. I am now drawing towards an abode that looks brighter as I
approach it: this expectation cheers my afflictions; and though I leave a helpless
family of orphans behind me, yet they will not be utterly forsaken; some
friend, perhaps, will be found to assist them for the sake of their poor father,
and some may charitably relieve them for the sake of their Heavenly Father."</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as I spoke, my wife, whom I had not seen that day before, appeared
with looks of terror, and making efforts, but unable, to speak. "Why, my
love," cried I, "why will you thus increase my afflictions by your own?
What though no submission can turn our severe master, though he has doomed
me to die in this place of wretchedness, and though we have lost a darling
child, yet still you will find comfort in your other children when I shall be no
more." "We have indeed lost," returned she, "a darling child!—My Sophia,
my dearest, is gone—snatched from us, carried off by ruffians!"</p>

<p class='c009'>"How, madam!" cried my fellow-prisoner, "Miss Sophia carried off by
villains! Sure it cannot be!"</p>

<p class='c009'>She could only answer with a fixed look and a flood of tears. But one of
the prisoners' wives, who was present, and came in with her, gave us a more
distinct account: she informed us that as my wife, my daughter, and herself
were taking a walk together on the great road a little way out of the village,
a post-chaise and pair drove up to them, and instantly stopped. Upon which
a well-dressed man, but not Mr. Thornhill, stepping out, clasped my daughter
round the waist, and forcing her in, bid the postilion drive on, so that they
were out of sight in a moment."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_141'></a>"Now," cried I, "the sum of my miseries is made up; nor is it in the
power of anything on earth to give me another pang. What! not one left!
not to leave me one! The monster! The child that was next my heart! She had
the beauty of an angel, and almost the wisdom of an angel. But support that
woman, nor let her fall.—Not to leave me one!" "Alas, my husband!" said
my wife, "you seem to want comfort even more than I. Our distresses are
great; but I could bear this and more if I saw you but easy. They may take
away my children, and all the world, if they leave me but you."</p>

<p class='c009'>My son who was present, endeavoured to moderate her grief. He bade us
take comfort, for he hoped that we might still have reason to be thankful.
"My child," cried I, "look round the world, and see if there be any happiness
left me now. Is not every ray of comfort shut out, while all our bright prospects
only lie beyond the grave?" "My dear father," returned he, "I hope
there is still something that will give you an interval of satisfaction, for I
have a letter from my brother George." "What of him, child?" interrupted
I. "Does he know our misery? I hope my boy is exempt from any part of
what his wretched family suffers." "Yes, sir," returned he, "he is perfectly
gay, cheerful, and happy. His letter brings nothing but good news: he is the
favourite of his colonel, who promises to procure him the very next lieutenancy
that becomes vacant."</p>

<p class='c009'>"But are you sure of all this?" cried my wife, "are you sure that nothing
ill has befallen my boy?" "Nothing, indeed, madam," returned my son;
"you shall see the letter, which will give you the highest pleasure: and if
anything can procure you comfort, I am sure that will." "But are you sure,"
still repeated she, "that the letter is from himself, and that he is really so
happy?" "Yes, madam," replied he, "it is certainly his, and he will one day
be the credit and the support of our family." "Then I thank Providence,"
cried she, "that my last letter to him has miscarried. Yes, my dear," continued
she, turning to me, "I will now confess that though the hand of Heaven
is sore upon us in other instances, it has been favourable here. By the last
letter I wrote my son, which was in the bitterness of anger, I desired him,
upon his mother's blessing, and if he had the heart of a man, to see justice
done his father and sister, and avenge our cause. But, thanks to Him who
directs all things, it has miscarried, and I am at rest."</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'>"Woman," cried I, "thou hast done very ill, and at another time my
reproaches might have been more severe. Oh! what a tremendous gulf hast
thou escaped, that would have buried both thee and him in endless ruin!
Providence, indeed, has here been kinder to us than we to ourselves. It
has reserved that son to be the father and protector of my children
when I shall be away. How unjustly did I complain of being stripped of
every comfort, when still I hear that he is happy, and insensible of
<a id='Page_143'></a> our afflictions; still kept in reserve to support his widowed mother,
and to protect his brothers and sisters! But what sisters has he left?
He has no sisters now: they are all gone, robbed from me, and I am
undone!" "Father," interrupted my son, "I beg you will give me leave
to read this letter: I know it will please you." Upon which, with my
permission, he read as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'>"<span class='sc'>Honoured Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='c009'>"I have called off my imagination a few moments from the pleasures that
surround me, to fix it upon objects that are still more pleasing—the dear little
fireside at home. My fancy draws that harmless group as listening to every
line of this with great composure. I view those faces with delight, which
never felt the deforming hand of ambition or distress. But whatever your
happiness may be at home, I am sure it will be some addition to it to hear that
I am perfectly pleased with my situation, and every way happy here.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Our regiment is countermanded, and is not to leave the kingdom; the
colonel, who professes himself my friend, takes me with him to all companies
where he is acquainted, and, after my first visit, I generally find myself received
with increased respect upon repeating it. I danced last night with Lady
G——, and, could I forget you know whom, I might perhaps be successful.
But it is my fate still to remember others, while I am myself forgotten by most
of my absent friends; and in this number I fear, sir, that I must consider you,
for I have long expected the pleasure of a letter from home to no purpose.
Olivia and Sophia, too, promised to write, but seem to have forgotten me.
Tell them that they are two arrant little baggages, and that I am at this moment
in a most violent passion with them—yet still, I know not how, though
I want to bluster a little, my heart is respondent only to softer emotions. Then
tell them, sir, that after all I love them affectionately; and be assured of my
ever remaining</p>

<div class='c014'>"<span class='sc'>Your dutiful Son</span>."</div>
<p class='c008'>"In all our miseries," cried I, "what thanks have we not to return, that
one at least of our family is exempted from what we suffer! Heaven be his
guard, and keep my boy thus happy, to be the support of his widowed mother
and the father of these two babes, which is all the patrimony I can now
bequeath him! May he keep their innocence from the temptations of want,
and be their conductor in the paths of honour! "I had scarcely said these
words, when a noise like that of a tumult seemed to proceed from the prison
<a id='Page_144'></a>below; it died away soon after, and a clanking of fetters was heard along the
passage that led to my apartment. The keeper of the prison entered, holding
a man all bloody, wounded, and fettered with the heaviest irons. I looked
with compassion upon the wretch as he approached me, but with horror when
I found it was my own son! "My George! my George! and do I behold thee
thus? wounded! fettered! Is this thy happiness! Is this the manner you
return to me! Oh that this sight would break my heart at once, and let
me die!"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Where, sir, is your fortitude?" returned my son, with an intrepid voice;
"I must suffer; my life is forfeited, and let them take it."</p>

<p class='c009'>I tried to restrain my passion for a few minutes in silence, but I thought I
should have died with the effort. "O my boy, my heart weeps to behold thee
thus, and I cannot, cannot help it! In the moment that I thought thee blest,
and prayed for thy safety, to behold thee thus again, chained, wounded! And
yet the death of the youthful is happy. But I am old, a very old man, and
have lived to see this day; to see my children all untimely falling about me,
while I continue a wretched survivor in the midst of ruin! May all the
curses that ever sunk a soul fall heavy upon the murderer of my children!
May he live, like me, to see——"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Hold, sir!" replied my son, "or I shall blush for thee. How, sir! forgetful
of your age, your holy calling, thus to arrogate the justice of Heaven, and
fling those curses upward that must soon descend to crush thy own grey head
with destruction! No, sir, let it be your care now to fit me for that vile death
I must shortly suffer, to arm me with hope and resolution, to give me courage
to drink of that bitterness which must shortly be my portion."</p>

<p class='c009'>"My child, you must not die! I am sure no offence of thine can deserve
so vile a punishment. My George could never be guilty of any crime to make
his ancestors ashamed of him."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Mine, sir," returned my son, "is, I fear, an unpardonable one. When I
received my mother's letter from home, I immediately came down, determined
to punish the betrayer of our honour, and sent him an order to meet me, which
he answered, not in person, but by despatching four of his domestics to seize
me. I wounded one who first assaulted me, and I fear desperately; but the
rest made me their prisoner. The coward is determined to put the law in
execution against me; the proofs are undeniable: I have sent a challenge, and
as I am the first aggressor upon the statute, I see no hopes of pardon. But
you have often charmed me with your lessons of fortitude; let me now, sir,
find them in your example."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_145'></a>"And, my son, you shall find them. I am now raised above this world,
and all the pleasures it can produce. From this moment I break from my
heart all the ties that held it down to earth, and will prepare to fit us both for
eternity. Yes, my son, I will point out the way, and my soul shall guide yours
in the ascent, for we will take our flight together. I now see and am convinced
you can expect no pardon here, and I can only exhort you to seek it at that
greatest tribunal where we both shall shortly answer. But let us not be niggardly
in our exhortations, but let all our fellow-prisoners have a share. Good
gaoler, let them be permitted to stand here, while I attempt to improve them."
Thus saying, I made an effort to rise from my straw, but wanted strength, and
was able only to recline against the wall. The prisoners assembled themselves
according to my directions, for they loved to hear my counsel; my son and his
mother supported me on either side; I looked and saw that none were wanting,
and then addressed them with the following exhortation.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XXIX.</i><br /> <br /><i>The equal dealings of Providence demonstrated<br />with regard to the happy and the miserable here below,<br />that, from the nature of pleasure<br />and pain, the wretched must be repaid the balance of their<br />sufferings in the life hereafter.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>"My friends, my children, and fellow-sufferers, when I reflect on the distribution
of good and evil here below, I find that much has been given man to
enjoy, yet still more to suffer. Though we should examine the whole world,
we shall not find one man so happy as to have nothing left to wish for: but we
daily see thousands who by suicide show us they have nothing left to hope. In
this life, then, it appears that we cannot be entirely blest; but yet we may be
completely miserable.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Why man should thus feel pain; why our wretchedness should be
requisite in the formation of universal felicity; why, when all other systems
are made perfect by the perfection of their subordinate parts, the great system
should require for its perfection parts that are not only subordinate to others,
but imperfect in themselves—these are questions that never can be explained,
and might be useless if known. On this subject Providence has thought fit to
elude our curiosity, satisfied with granting us motives to consolation.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id015'>
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
<img src='images/i_165.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>"<i>The prisoners assembled themselves according<br />to my directions, for they loved to hear my counsel.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 144.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>"In this situation man has called in the friendly assistance of philosophy;
and Heaven, seeing the incapacity of that to console him, has given him the
aid of religion. The consolations of philosophy are very amusing, but often
<a id='Page_147'></a>fallacious. It tells us that life is filled with comforts, if we will but enjoy them;
and on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have miseries here, life is
short, and they will soon be over. Thus do these consolations destroy each
other; for if life is a place of comfort, its shortness must be misery; and if it
be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philosophy is weak; but religion
comforts in a higher strain. Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and
preparing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body, and is
all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making himself a heaven of happiness
here; while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his
vices, shrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the
vengeance of Heaven. To religion, then, we must hold in every circumstance
of life for our truest comfort; for, if already we are happy, it is a pleasure to
think that we can make that happiness unending; and, if we are miserable, it
is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest. Thus, to the fortunate,
religion holds out a continuance of bliss; to the wretched, a change from pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>"But though religion is very kind to all men, it has promised peculiar
rewards to the unhappy. The sick, the naked, the houseless, the heavy-laden,
and the prisoner, have ever most frequent promises in our sacred law. The
Author of our religion everywhere professes Himself the wretch's friend; and,
unlike the false ones of this world, bestows all His caresses upon the forlorn.
The unthinking have censured this as partiality, as a preference without merit
to deserve it. But they never reflect, that it is not in the power even of Heaven
itself to make the offer of unceasing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the
miserable. To the first, eternity is but a single blessing, since, at most, it but
increases what they already possess. To the latter, it is a double advantage;
for it diminishes their pain here, and rewards them with heavenly bliss hereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>"But Providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than to the rich;
for as it thus makes the life after death more desirable, so it smooths the passage
there. The wretched have had a long familiarity with every face of terror.
The man of sorrow lays himself quietly down, with no possessions to regret,
and but few ties to stop his departure; he feels only nature's pang in the final
separation, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before;
for, after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death opens in the
constitution, nature kindly covers with insensibility.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Thus Providence has given to the wretched two advantages over the
happy in this life—greater felicity in dying, and in heaven all that superiority
of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment. And this superiority, my
<a id='Page_148'></a>friends, is no small advantage, and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor
man in the parable; for though he was already in heaven, and felt all the raptures
it could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happiness, that
he had once been wretched, and now was comforted; that he had known what
it was to be miserable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Thus, my friends, you see religion does what philosophy could never do:
it shows the equal dealings of Heaven to the happy and the unhappy, and levels
all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard. It gives to both rich and
poor the same happiness hereafter, and equal hopes to aspire after it; but if
the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasure here, the poor have the endless
satisfaction of knowing what it was once to be miserable, when crowned
with endless felicity hereafter; and even though this should be called a small
advantage, yet, being an eternal one, it must make up by duration what the
temporal happiness of the great may have exceeded by intenseness.</p>

<p class='c009'>"These are, therefore, the consolations which the wretched have peculiar to
themselves, and in which they are above the rest of mankind; in other respects
they are below them. They who would know the miseries of the poor, must
see life and endure it. To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy is
only repeating what none either believe or practise. The men who have the
necessaries of living are not poor; and they who want them must be miserable.
Yes, my friends, we must be miserable. No vain efforts of a refined
imagination can soothe the wants of nature, can give elastic sweetness to the
dank vapour of a dungeon, or ease to the throbbings of a broken heart. Let
the philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist all these.
Alas! the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain. Death is
slight, and any man may sustain it; but torments are dreadful, and these no
man can endure.</p>

<p class='c009'>"To us, then, my friends, the promises of happiness in heaven should be
peculiarly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are, indeed, of all
men the most miserable. When I look round these gloomy walls, made to
terrify as well as to confine us; this light, that only serves to show the horrors
of the place; those shackles, that tyranny has imposed or crime made necessary;
when I survey these emaciated looks, and hear those groans; Oh, my
friends, what a glorious exchange would heaven be for these! To fly through
regions unconfined as air—to bask in the sunshine of eternal bliss—to carol
over endless hymns of praise—to have no master to threaten or insult us, but
the form of Goodness Himself for ever in our eyes: when I think of these
<a id='Page_149'></a>things, death becomes the messenger of very glad tidings; when I think of
these things, his sharpest arrow becomes the staff of my support; when I
think of these things, what is there in life worth having? when I think of
these things, what is there that should not be spurned away? Kings in their
palaces should groan for such advantages; but we, humbled as we are, should
yearn for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>"And shall these things be ours? Ours they will certainly be, if we but
try for them; and what is a comfort, we are shut out from many temptations
that would retard our pursuit. Only let us try for them, and they will certainly
be ours; and what is still a comfort, shortly too; for if we look back on a
past life, it appears but a very short span; and whatever we may think of the
rest of life, it will yet be found of less duration: as we grow older the days
seem to grow shorter, and our intimacy with Time ever lessens the perception
of his stay. Then let us take comfort now, for we shall soon be at our journey's
end; we shall soon lay down the heavy burden laid by Heaven upon us;
and though death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the
weary traveller with the view, and, like the horizon, flies before him, yet the
time will certainly and shortly come when we shall cease from our toil; when
the luxurious great ones of the world shall no more tread us to the earth;
when we shall think with pleasure of our sufferings below; when we shall be
surrounded with all our friends, or such as deserved our friendship; when our
bliss shall be unutterable, and still, to crown all, unending."</p>

<p class='c008'>When I had thus finished, and my audience was retired, the gaoler, who was
one of the most humane of his profession, hoped I would not be displeased, as
what he did was but his duty; observing, that he must be obliged to remove
my son into a stronger cell, but that he should be permitted to visit me every
morning. I thanked him for his clemency, and grasping my boy's hand, bade
him farewell, and be mindful of the great duty that was before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>I again therefore laid me down, and one of my little ones sat by my bedside
<a id='Page_150'></a>reading, when Mr. Jenkinson entering, informed me that there was news
of my daughter; for that she was seen by a person about two hours before in
a strange gentleman's company, and that they had stopped at a neighbouring
village for refreshment, and seemed as if returning to town. He had scarcely
delivered his news, when the gaoler came with looks of haste and pleasure to
inform me that my daughter was found! Moses came running in a moment
after, crying out that his sister Sophy was below, and coming up with our old

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Just as he delivered this news my dearest girl entered, and, with looks
almost wild with pleasure, ran to kiss me in a transport of affection. Her
mother's tears and silence also showed her pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Here, papa," cried the charming girl, "here is the brave man to whom I
owe my delivery; to this gentleman's intrepidity I am indebted for my happiness
and safety——." A kiss from Mr. Burchell, whose pleasure seemed even
greater than hers, interrupted what she was going to add.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_151'></a>"Ah, Mr. Burchell!" cried I, "this is but a wretched habitation you find
us in; and we are now very different from what you last saw us. You were
ever our friend: we have long discovered our errors with regard to you, and
repented of our ingratitude. After the vile usage you then received at my
hands, I am almost ashamed to behold your face; yet I hope you will forgive
me, as I was deceived by a base, ungenerous wretch, who, under the mask of
friendship, has undone me."</p>

<p class='c009'>"It is impossible," replied Mr. Burchell, "that I should forgive you, as you
never deserved my resentment. I partly saw your delusion then, and, as it
was out of my power to restrain, I could only pity it."</p>

<p class='c009'>"It was ever my conjecture," cried I, "that your mind was noble; but now
I find it so. But tell me, my dear child, how thou hast been relieved, or who
the ruffians were that carried thee away?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Indeed, sir," replied she, "as to the villain who carried me off I am yet
ignorant. For as my mamma and I were walking out, he came behind us, and
almost before I could call for help forced me into the post-chaise, and in an
instant the horses drove away. I met several on the road to whom I cried
out for assistance, but they disregarded my entreaties. In the meantime the
ruffian himself used every art to hinder me from crying out: he flattered and
threatened me by turns, and swore that, if I continued but silent, he intended
no harm. In the meantime I had broken the canvas that he had drawn up,
and whom should I perceive at some distance but your old friend Mr. Burchell,
walking along with his usual swiftness, with the great stick for which
we used so much to ridicule him! As soon as we came within hearing, I
called out to him by name, and entreated his help. I repeated my exclamations
several times, upon which, with a very loud voice, he bade the postilion
stop; but the boy took no notice, but drove on with still greater speed. I
now thought he could never overtake us, when in less than a minute I saw
Mr. Burchell come running up by the side of the horses, and with one
blow knocked the postilion to the ground. The horses, when he was fallen,
soon stopped of themselves, and the ruffian stepping out, with oaths and
menaces, drew his sword, and ordered him at his peril to retire; but Mr.
Burchell running up, shivered his sword to pieces, and then pursued him for
near a quarter of a mile; but he made his escape. I was by this time come
out myself, willing to assist my deliverer; but he soon returned to me in
triumph. The postilion, who was recovered, was going to make his escape
too; but Mr. Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again, and drive back
<a id='Page_152'></a>to town. Finding it impossible to resist, he reluctantly complied, though the
wound he had received seemed to me at least to be dangerous. He continued
to complain of the pain as we drove along, so that he at last excited Mr.
Burchell's compassion, who, at my request, exchanged him for another at an
inn where we called on our return."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Welcome, then," cried I, "my child; and thou, her gallant deliverer, a
thousand welcomes. Though our cheer is but wretched, yet our hearts are
ready to receive you. And now, Mr. Burchell, as you have delivered my
girl, if you think her a recompense, she is yours: if you can stoop to an
alliance with a family so poor as mine, take her, obtain her consent, as I
know you have her heart, and you have mine. And let me tell you, sir, that
I give you no small treasure: she has been celebrated for beauty, it is true,
but that is not my meaning—I give you a treasure in her mind."</p>

<p class='c009'>"But I suppose, sir," cried Mr. Burchell, "that you are apprised of my
circumstances, and of my incapacity to support her as she deserves?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"If your present objection," replied I, "be meant as an evasion of my
offer, I desist; but I know no man so worthy to deserve her as you; and if I
could give her thousands, and thousands sought her from me, yet my honest
brave Burchell should be my dearest choice."</p>

<p class='c009'>To all this his silence alone seemed to give a mortifying refusal; and
without the least reply to my offer, he demanded if we could not be furnished
with refreshments from the next inn; to which being answered in the affirmative,
he ordered them to send in the best dinner that could be provided upon
such short notice. He bespoke also a dozen of their best wine, and some
cordials for me; adding, with a smile, that he would stretch a little for once;
and, though in a prison, asserted he was never better disposed to be merry.
The waiter soon made his appearance with preparations for dinner; a table
was lent us by the gaoler, who seemed remarkably assiduous; the wine was
disposed in order, and two very well-dressed dishes were brought in.</p>

<p class='c009'>My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother's melancholy situation,
and we all seemed unwilling to damp her cheerfulness by the relation. But
it was in vain that I attempted to appear cheerful; the circumstances of my
unfortunate son broke through all efforts to dissemble; so that I was at last
obliged to damp our mirth by relating his misfortunes, and wishing he might
be permitted to share with us in this little interval of satisfaction. After my
guests were recovered from the consternation my account had produced, I
requested also that Mr. Jenkinson, a fellow-prisoner, might be admitted; and
<a id='Page_153'></a>the gaoler granted my request with an air of unusual submission. The
clanking of my son's irons was no sooner heard along the passage, than his
sister ran impatiently to meet him; while Mr. Burchell, in the meantime,
asked me if my son's name was George; to which replying in the affirmative,
he still continued silent. As soon as my boy entered the room, I could
perceive he regarded Mr. Burchell with a look of astonishment and reverence.
"Come on," cried I, "my son; though we are fallen very low, yet Providence
has been pleased to grant us some small relaxation from pain. Thy sister is
restored to us, and there is her deliverer; to that brave man it is that I am
indebted for yet having a daughter; give him, my boy, the hand of friendship—he
deserves our warmest gratitude."</p>

<p class='c009'>My son seemed all this while regardless of what I said, and still continued
fixed at a respectful distance. "My dear brother," cried his sister, "why
don't you thank my good deliverer? The brave should ever love each other."</p>

<p class='c009'>He still continued his silence and astonishment; till our guest at last
perceived himself to be known, and assuming all his native dignity, desired
my son to come forward. Never before had I seen anything so truly majestic
as the air he assumed upon this occasion. The greatest object in the universe,
says a certain philosopher, is a good man struggling with adversity; yet there
is a still greater, which is the good man that comes to relieve it. After he had
regarded my son for some time with a superior air, "I again find," said he,
"unthinking boy, that the same crime—". But here he was interrupted by
one of the gaoler's servants, who came to inform us that a person of distinction,
who had driven into town with a chariot and several attendants, sent his
respects to the gentleman that was with us, and begged to know when he
should think proper to be waited upon. "Bid the fellow wait," cried our
guest, "till I shall have leisure to receive him:" and then turning to my son,
"I again find, sir," proceeded he, "that you are guilty of the same offence for
which you once had my reproof, and for which the law is now preparing its
justest punishments. You imagine, perhaps, that a contempt for your own
life gives you a right to take that of another: but where, sir, is the difference
between the duellist, who hazards a life of no value, and the murderer, who
acts with greater security? Is it any diminution of the gamester's fraud,
when he alleges that he has staked a counter?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Alas, sir!" cried I, "whoever you are, pity the poor misguided creature;
for what he has done was in obedience to a deluded mother, who in the
bitterness of her resentment required him, upon her blessing, to avenge her
<a id='Page_154'></a>quarrel. Here, sir, is the letter which will serve to convince you of her
imprudence, and diminish his guilt."</p>

<div  class='figcenter id016'>
<img src='images/i_173.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>"What, Bill, you chubby rogue!" cried he,<br />"do you remember your old friend Burchell?"</i>—<i>p.</i> 155.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>He took the letter, and hastily read it over. "This," said he, "though not
<a id='Page_155'></a>a perfect excuse, is such a palliation of his fault as induces me to forgive him.
And now, sir," continued he, kindly taking my son by the hand, "I see you
are surprised at finding me here; but I have often visited prisons upon
occasions less interesting. I am now come to see justice done a worthy man,
for whom I have the most sincere esteem. I have long been a disguised
spectator of thy father's benevolence. I have at his little dwelling enjoyed
respect uncontaminated by flattery, and have received that happiness which
courts could not give, from the amusing simplicity round his fireside. My
nephew has been apprised of my intention of coming here, and I find he is
arrived: it would be wronging him and you to condemn him without examination;
if there be injury there shall be redress; and this I may say without
boasting, that none have ever taxed the injustice of Sir William Thornhill."</p>

<p class='c009'>We now found that the personage whom we had so long entertained as a
harmless, amusing companion, was no other than the celebrated Sir William
Thornhill, to whose virtues and singularities scarcely any were strangers. The
poor Mr. Burchell was in reality a man of large fortune and great interest, to
whom senates listened with applause, and whom party heard with conviction;
who was the friend of his country, but loyal to his king. My poor wife,
recollecting her former familiarity, seemed to shrink with apprehension; but
Sophia, who a few moments before thought him her own, now perceiving the
immense distance to which he was removed by fortune, was unable to conceal
her tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Ah, sir," cried my wife, with a piteous aspect, "how is it possible that I
can ever have your forgiveness? The slights you received from me the last
time I had the honour of seeing you at our house, and the jokes which I so
audaciously threw out—these, sir, I fear, can never be forgiven."</p>

<p class='c009'>"My dear, good lady," returned he, with a smile, "if you had your joke, I
had my answer. I'll leave it to all the company if mine were not as good as
yours. To say the truth, I know nobody whom I am disposed to be angry
with at present, but the fellow who so frightened my little girl here! I had
not even time to examine the rascal's person, so as to describe him in an
advertisement. Can you tell me, Sophia, my dear, whether you should know
him again?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Indeed, sir," replied she, "I cannot be positive; yet, now I recollect, he
had a large mark over one of his eyebrows." "I ask pardon, madam," interrupted
Jenkinson, who was by, "but be so good as to inform me if the fellow
wore his own red hair." "Yes; I think so," cried Sophia. "And did your
<a id='Page_156'></a>honour," continued he, turning to Sir William, "observe the length of his legs?"
"I can't be sure of their length," cried the baronet, "but I am convinced of
their swiftness; for he outran me, which is what I thought few men in the
kingdom could have done." "Please your honour," cried Jenkinson, "I know
the man; it is certainly the same: the best runner in England; he has beaten
Pinwire, of Newcastle. Timothy Baxter is his name: I know him perfectly,
and the very place of his retreat at this moment. If your honour will bid
Mr. Gaoler let two of his men go with me, I'll engage to produce him to you
in an hour at farthest." Upon this the gaoler was called, who instantly
appearing, Sir William demanded if he knew him. "Yes, please your honour,"
replied the gaoler, "I know Sir William Thornhill well; and everybody that
knows anything of him, will desire to know more of him." "Well, then,"
said the baronet, "my request is, that you will permit this man and two of
your servants to go upon a message by my authority, and, as I am in the
commission of the peace, I undertake to secure you." "Your promise is
sufficient," replied the other, "and you may, at a minute's warning, send
them over England whenever your honour thinks fit."</p>

<p class='c009'>In pursuance of the gaoler's compliance, Jenkinson was despatched in
pursuit of Timothy Baxter, while we were amused with the assiduity of our
youngest boy, Bill, who had just come in, and climbed up to Sir William's
neck in order to kiss him. His mother was immediately going to chastise
his familiarity, but the worthy man prevented her; and taking the child, all
ragged as he was, upon his knee, "What, Bill, you chubby rogue!" cried he,
"do you remember your old friend Burchell? And Dick, too, my honest
veteran, are you here? You shall find I have not forgot you." So saying,
he gave each a large piece of gingerbread, which the poor fellows ate very
heartily, as they had got that morning but a very scanty breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now sat down to dinner, which was almost cold: but previously, my
arm still continuing painful, Sir William wrote a prescription, for he had made
the study of physic his amusement, and was more than moderately skilled in
the profession: this being sent to an apothecary who lived in the place, my
arm was dressed, and I found almost instantaneous relief. We were waited
upon at dinner by the gaoler himself, who was willing to do our guest all the
honour in his power. But before we had well dined, another message was
brought from his nephew, desiring permission to appear, in order to vindicate
his innocence and honour; with which request the baronet complied, and
desired Mr. Thornhill to be introduced.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XXXI.</i><br /> <br /><i>Former benevolence now repaid with unexpected interest.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Mr. Thornhill made his entrance with a smile, which he seldom wanted,
and was going to embrace his uncle, which the other repulsed with an air of
disdain. "No fawning, sir, at present," cried the baronet, with a look of
severity; "the only way to my heart is by the road of honour; but here I
only see complicated instances of falsehood, cowardice, and oppression. How
is it, sir, that this poor man, for whom I know you professed a friendship, is
used thus hardly? His daughter vilely seduced as a recompense for his
hospitality, and he himself thrown into prison, perhaps but for resenting the
insult. His son, too, whom you feared to face as a man——"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Is it possible, sir," interrupted his nephew, "that my uncle should
object that as a crime which his repeated instructions alone have persuaded
me to avoid?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Your rebuke," cried Sir William, "is just: you have acted in this
instance prudently and well, though not quite as your father would have
done: my brother, indeed, was the soul of honour; but thou——yes, you have
acted in this instance perfectly right, and it has my warmest approbation."</p>

<p class='c009'>"And I hope," said his nephew, "that the rest of my conduct will not be
found to deserve censure. I appeared, sir, with this gentleman's daughter at
some places of public amusement; thus, what was levity scandal called by a
harsher name, and it was reported that I had debauched her. I waited on
her father in person, willing to clear the thing to his satisfaction, and he
received me only with insult and abuse. As for the rest, with regard to his
being here, my attorney, and steward can best inform you, as I commit the
management of business entirely to them. If he has contracted debts, and is
unwilling, or even unable, to pay them, it is their business to proceed in this
manner; and I see no hardship or injustice in pursuing the most legal means
of redress."</p>

<p class='c009'>"If this," cried Sir William, "be as you have stated it, there is nothing
unpardonable in your offences; and though your conduct might have been
more generous in not suffering this gentleman to be oppressed by subordinate
tyranny, yet it has been at least equitable."</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>"He cannot contradict a singular particular," replied the squire; "I defy
him to do so; and several of my servants are ready to attest what I say.
Thus, sir," continued he, finding that I was silent, for in fact I could not
contradict him: "thus, sir, my own innocence is vindicated: but though at
your entreaty I am ready to forgive this gentleman every other offence, yet his
attempts to lessen me in your esteem excite a resentment that I cannot
govern; and this, too, at a time when his son was actually preparing to take
away my life; this, I say, was such guilt, that I am determined to let the law
take its course. I have here the challenge that was sent me, and two witnesses
to prove it; one of my servants has been wounded dangerously; and even
<a id='Page_159'></a>though my uncle himself should dissuade me, which I know he will not, yet
I will see public justice done, and he shall suffer for it."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Thou monster!" cried my wife, "hast thou not had vengeance enough
already, but must my poor boy feel thy cruelty? I hope that good Sir
William will protect us, for my son is as innocent as a child; I am sure he is,
and never did harm to man."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Madam," replied the good man, "your wishes for his safety are not
greater than mine; but I am sorry to find his guilt too plain; and if my
nephew persists——" But the appearance of Jenkinson and the gaolers two
servants now called off our attention, who entered hauling in a tall man, very
genteelly dressed, and answering the description already given of the ruffian
who had carried off my daughter. "Here," cried Jenkinson, pulling him
in, "Here we have him: and, if ever there was a candidate for Tyburn, this
is one."</p>

<p class='c009'>The moment Mr. Thornhill perceived the prisoner, and Jenkinson who had
him in custody, he seemed to shrink backward with terror. His face became
pale with conscious guilt, and he would have withdrawn; but Jenkinson, who
perceived his design, stopped him. "What, squire!" cried he, "are you
ashamed of your two old acquaintances, Jenkinson and Baxter? But this is
the way that all great men forget their friends, though I am resolved we will
not forget you. Our prisoner, please your honour," continued he, turning to
Sir William, "has already confessed all. This is the gentleman reported to be
so dangerously wounded; he declares that it was Mr. Thornhill who first put
him upon this affair; that he gave him the clothes he now wears to appear
like a gentleman, and furnished him with the post-chaise. The plan was laid
between them, that he should carry off the young lady to a place of safety, and
that there he should threaten and terrify her; but Mr. Thornhill was to come
in in the meantime, as if by accident, to her rescue, and that they should
fight awhile, and then he was to run off, by which Mr. Thornhill would have
the better opportunity of gaining her affections himself under the character of
her defender."</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir William remembered the coat to have been frequently worn by his
nephew, and all the rest the prisoner himself confirmed by a more circumstantial
account; concluding, that Mr. Thornhill had often declared to him
that he was in love with both sisters at the same time.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Heavens!" cried Sir William, "what a viper have I been fostering in my
bosom! And so fond of public justice, too, as he seemed to be! But he
<a id='Page_160'></a>shall have it. Secure him, Mr. Gaoler. Yet hold; I fear there is no legal
evidence to detain him."</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon this, Mr. Thornhill, with the utmost humility, entreated that two
such abandoned wretches might not be admitted as evidence against him, but
that his servants should be examined. "Your servants!" replied Sir William;
"wretch! call them yours no longer: but come, let us hear what those fellows
have to say: let his butler be called."</p>

<p class='c009'>When the butler was introduced, he soon perceived by his former master's
looks that all his power was now over. "Tell me," cried Sir William, sternly,
"have you ever seen your master and that fellow dressed up in his clothes
in company together?" "Yes, please your honour," cried the butler, "a
thousand times: he was the man that always brought him his ladies."
"How!" interrupted young Mr. Thornhill, "this to my face?" "Yes,"
replied the butler; "or to any man's face. To tell you a truth, Master
Thornhill, I never either loved you or liked you, and I don't care if I tell you
now a piece of my mind." "Now then," cried Jenkinson, "tell his honour
whether you know anything of me." "I can't say," replied the butler, "that
I know much good of you. The night that gentleman's daughter was deluded
to our house, you were one of them." "So then," cried Sir William, "I find
you have brought a very fine witness to prove your innocence; thou stain to
humanity! to associate with such wretches! But," continuing his examination,
"you tell me, Mr. Butler, that this was the person who brought him this
old gentleman's daughter." "No, please your honour," replied the butler,
"he did not bring her, for the squire himself undertook that business; but
he brought the priest that pretended to marry them."</p>

<p class='c009'>"It is but too true," cried Jenkinson; "I cannot deny it; that was the
employment assigned to me, and I confess it to my confusion."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed the worthy baronet, "how every new discovery
of his villainy alarms me! All his guilt is now too plain, and I find
his present prosecution was dictated by tyranny, cowardice, and revenge: at
my request, Mr. Gaoler, set this young officer, now your prisoner, free, and
trust to me for the consequences. I'll make it my business to set the
affair in a proper light to my friend the magistrate who has committed him.
But where is the unfortunate young lady herself? Let her appear to confront
this wretch. I long to know by what arts he has seduced her. Entreat her
to come in. Where is she?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Ah, sir!" said I, "that question stings me to the heart. I was once
<a id='Page_161'></a>indeed happy in a daughter, but her miseries——" Another interruption
here prevented me; for who should make her appearance but Miss Arabella
Wilmot, who was the next day to have been married to Mr. Thornhill.
Nothing could equal her surprise at seeing Sir William and his nephew here
before her; for her arrival was quite accidental. It happened that she and
the old gentleman, her father, were passing through the town on their way to
her aunt's, who had insisted that her nuptials with Mr. Thornhill should be
consummated at her house; but, stopping for refreshment, they put up at an
inn at the other end of the town. It was there, from the window, that the
young lady happened to observe one of my little boys playing in the street,
and, instantly sending a footman to bring the child to her, she learnt from
him some account of our misfortunes, but was still kept ignorant of young
Mr. Thornhill's being the cause. Though her father made several remonstrances
on the impropriety of her going to a prison to visit us, yet they
were ineffectual: she desired the child to conduct her, which he did, and it
was thus she surprised us at a juncture so unexpected.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor can I go on without a reflection on those accidental meetings, which,
though they happen every day, seldom excite our surprise but upon some
extraordinary occasion. To what a fortuitous concurrence do we not owe
every pleasure and convenience of our lives! How many seeming accidents
must unite before we can be clothed or fed! The peasant must be disposed
to labour, the shower must fall, the wind fill the merchant's sail, or numbers
must want the usual supply.</p>

<p class='c009'>We all continued silent for some moments, while my charming pupil,
which was the name I generally gave this young lady, united in her looks
compassion and astonishment, which gave new finishings to her beauty.
"Indeed, my dear Mr. Thornhill," cried she to the squire, who she supposed
was come here to succour and not to oppress us, "I take it a little unkindly
that you should come here without me, or never inform me of the situation of
a family so dear to us both: you know I should take as much pleasure in
contributing to the relief of my reverend old master here, whom I shall ever
esteem, as you can. But I find that, like your uncle, you take a pleasure in
doing good in secret."</p>

<p class='c009'>"He find pleasure in doing good!" cried Sir William, interrupting her:
"no, my dear, his pleasures are as base as he is. You see in him, madam, as
complete a villain as ever disgraced humanity. A wretch, who, after having
deluded this poor man's daughter, after plotting against the innocence of her
<a id='Page_162'></a>sister, has thrown the father into prison, and the eldest son into fetters, because
he had the courage to face her betrayer! And give me leave, madam, now to
congratulate you upon an escape from the embraces of such a monster."</p>

<div  class='figcenter id029'>

<p>"<i>We had now, therefore, the satisfaction<br />of seeing them fly into each other's arms<br />in a transport.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 164.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_163'></a>"O goodness!" cried the lovely girl, "how have I been deceived! Mr.
Thornhill informed me, for certain, that this gentleman's eldest son, Captain
Primrose, was gone off to America with his new-married lady."</p>

<p class='c009'>"My sweetest miss," cried my wife, "he has told you nothing but falsehoods.
My son George never left the kingdom, nor ever was married.
Though you have forsaken him, he has always loved you too well to think of
anybody else; and I have heard him say he would die a bachelor for your
sake." She then proceeded to expatiate upon the sincerity of her son's
passion; she set his duel with Mr. Thornhill in a proper light; from thence
she made a rapid digression to the squire's debaucheries, his pretended
marriages, and ended with a most insulting picture of his cowardice.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Good Heaven!" cried Miss Wilmot, "how very near have I been to the
brink of ruin! but how great is my pleasure to have escaped it! Ten
thousand falsehoods has this gentleman told me! He had at last art enough
to persuade me that my promise to the only man I esteemed was no longer
binding, since he had been unfaithful. By his falsehoods I was taught to
detest one equally brave and generous."</p>

<p class='c009'>But by this time my son was freed from the incumbrances of justice, as
the person supposed to be wounded was detected to be an impostor. Mr.
Jenkinson also, who had acted as his valet-de-chambre, had dressed up his
hair, and furnished him with whatever was necessary to make a genteel
appearance. He now, therefore, entered, handsomely dressed in his regimentals,
and without vanity (for I am above it) he appeared as handsome a
fellow as ever wore a military dress. As he entered, he made Miss Wilmot a
modest and distant bow, for he was not as yet acquainted with the change
which the eloquence of his mother had wrought in his favour. But no
decorums could restrain the impatience of his blushing mistress to be forgiven.
Her tears, her looks, all contributed to discover the real sensations of her heart,
for having forgotten her former promise, and having suffered herself to be
deluded by an impostor. My son appeared amazed at her condescension, and
could scarcely believe it real. "Sure, madam," cried he, "this is but delusion;
I can never have merited this! To be blessed thus, is to be too happy!"
"No sir," replied she, "I have been deceived, basely deceived, else nothing
could have ever made me unjust to my promise. You know my friendship,
you have long known it: but forget what I have done; and, as you once had
my warmest vows of constancy, you shall now have them repeated; and be
assured, that if your Arabella cannot be yours, she shall never be another's."
<a id='Page_164'></a>"And no other's you shall be," cried Sir William, "if I have any influence
with your father."</p>

<p class='c009'>This hint was sufficient for my son Moses, who immediately flew to the inn
where the old gentleman was, to inform him of every circumstance that had
happened. But in the meantime the squire, perceiving that he was on every
side undone, now finding that no hopes were left from flattery or dissimulation,
concluded that his wisest way would be to turn and face his pursuers.
Thus, laying aside all shame, he appeared the open, hardy villain. "I find,
then," cried he, "that I am to expect no justice here; but I am resolved it
shall be done me. You shall know, sir," turning to Sir William, "I am no
longer a poor dependant upon your favours. I scorn them. Nothing can
keep Miss Wilmot's fortune from me, which, I thank her father's assiduity, is
pretty large. The articles and a bond for her fortune are signed, and safe in
my possession. It was her fortune, not her person, that induced me to wish
for this match; and, possessed of the one, let who will take the other."</p>

<p class='c009'>This was an alarming blow: Sir William was sensible of the justice of his
claims, for he had been instrumental in drawing up the marriage-articles
himself. Miss Wilmot, therefore, perceiving that her fortune was irretrievably
lost, turning to my son, asked if the loss of fortune could lessen her value to
him. "Though fortune," said she, "is out of my power, at least I have my
hand to give."</p>

<p class='c009'>"And that, madam," cried her real lover, "was indeed all that you ever
had to give; at least, all that I ever thought worth the acceptance. And I
now protest, my Arabella, by all that's happy, your want of fortune this
moment increases my pleasure, as it serves to convince my sweet girl of my
sincerity."</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Wilmot now entering, he seemed not a little pleased at the danger his
daughter had just escaped, and readily consented to a dissolution of the match.
But finding that her fortune, which was secured to Mr. Thornhill by bond,
would not be given up, nothing could exceed his disappointment. He now
saw that his money must all go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own.
He could bear his being a rascal, but to want an equivalent to his daughter's
fortune was wormwood. He sat, therefore, for some minutes employed in
the most mortifying speculations, till Sir William attempted to lessen his
anxiety. "I must confess, sir," cried he, "that your present disappointment
does not entirely displease me. Your immoderate passion for wealth is now
justly punished. But though the young lady cannot be rich, she has still a
<a id='Page_165'></a>competence sufficient to give content. Here you see an honest young soldier,
who is willing to take her without fortune: they have long loved each other,
and for the friendship I bear his father, my interest shall not be wanting in his
promotion. Leave, then, that ambition which disappoints you, and for once
admit that happiness which courts your acceptance."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Sir William," replied the old gentleman, "be assured I never yet forced
her inclinations, nor will I now. If she still continues to love this young
gentleman, let her have him with all my heart. There is still, thank Heaven,
some fortune left, and your promise will make it something more. Only let
my old friend here" (meaning me) "give me a promise of settling six thousand
pounds upon my girl, if ever he should come to his fortune, and I am ready
this night to be the first to join them together."</p>

<p class='c009'>As it now remained with me to make the young couple happy, I readily
gave a promise of making the settlement he required; which, to one who had
such little expectations as I, was no great favour. We had now, therefore, the
satisfaction of seeing them fly into each other's arms in a transport. "After
all my misfortunes," cried my son George, "to be thus rewarded! Sure this
is more than I could ever have presumed to hope for. To be possessed of all
that's good, and after such an interval of pain! my warmest wishes could
never rise so high!" "Yes, my George," returned his lovely bride, "now let
the wretch take my fortune: since you are happy without it, so am I. Oh,
what an exchange have I made from the basest of men to the dearest, best!
Let him enjoy our fortune; I now can be happy even in indigence." "And I
promise you," cried the squire, with a malicious grin, "that I shall be very
happy with what you despise." "Hold, hold, sir!" cried Jenkinson; "there
are two words to that bargain. As for that lady's fortune, sir, you shall never
touch a single stiver of it. Pray, your honour," continued he to Sir William,
"can the squire have this lady's fortune if he be married to another?"
"How can you make such a simple demand?" replied the baronet:
"undoubtedly he cannot." "I am sorry for that," cried Jenkinson; "for as
this gentleman and I have been old fellow-sporters, I have a friendship for
him. But I must declare, well as I love him, that his contract is not worth
a tobacco-stopper, for he is married already." "You lie, like a rascal!"
returned the squire, who seemed roused by this insult; "I never was legally
married to any woman." "Indeed, begging your honour's pardon," replied
the other, "you were; and I hope you will show a proper return of friendship
to your own honest Jenkinson, who brings you a wife; and if the company
<a id='Page_166'></a>restrain their curiosity a few minutes, they shall see her." So saying, he went
off with his usual celerity, and left us all unable to form any probable conjecture
as to his design. "Aye, let him go," cried the squire: "whatever else
I may have done, I defy him there. I am too old now to be frightened
with squibs."</p>

<p>"<i>So saying, he put the license into the<br />baronet's hands, who read it, and found it<br />perfect in every respect.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 166.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>"I am surprised," said the baronet, "what the fellow can intend by this.
Some low piece of humour, I suppose." "Perhaps, sir," replied I, "he may
have a more serious meaning. For when we reflect on the various schemes
this gentleman has laid to seduce innocence, perhaps some one, more artful
<a id='Page_167'></a>than the rest, has been found able to deceive him. When we consider what
numbers he has ruined, how many parents now feel with anguish the infamy
and the contamination which he has brought into their families, it would not
surprise me if some one of them—Amazement! Do I see my lost daughter?
Do I hold her? It is, it is—my life, my happiness! I thought thee lost,
my Olivia, yet still I hold thee, and still thou shalt live to bless me." The
warmest transports of the fondest lover were not greater than mine, when I
saw him introduce my child, and held my daughter in my arms, whose silence
only spoke her raptures. "And art thou returned to me, my darling," cried
I, "to be my comfort in age?" "That she is," cried Jenkinson; "and make
much of her, for she is your own honourable child, and as honest a woman as
any in the whole room, let the other be who she will. And as for you, squire,
as sure as you stand there, this young lady is your lawful wedded wife: and
to convince you that I speak nothing but the truth, here is the license by
which you were married together." So saying, he put the license into the
baronet's hands, who read it, and found it perfect in every respect. "And
now, gentlemen," continued he, "I find you are surprised at all this; but a
very few words will explain the difficulty. That there squire of renown, for
whom I have a great friendship (but that's between ourselves) has often
employed me in doing odd little things for him. Among the rest he commissioned
me to procure him a false license, and a false priest, in order to
deceive this young lady. But as I was very much his friend, what did I do,
but went and got a true license and a true priest, and married them both as
fast as the cloth could make them. Perhaps you'll think it was generosity
made me do all this. But no. To my shame I confess it, my only design
was to keep the license, and let the squire know that I could prove it upon
him whenever I thought proper, and so make him come down whenever I
wanted money." A burst of pleasure now seemed to fill the whole apartment;
our joy even reached the common-room, where the prisoners themselves
sympathised,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>And shook their chains</div>
      <div class='line'>In transport and rude harmony.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Happiness was expanded upon every face, and even Olivia's cheeks seemed
flushed with pleasure. To be thus restored to reputation, to friends, and
fortune at once, was a rapture sufficient to stop the progress of decay, and
restore former health and vivacity. But, perhaps, among all, there was not
<a id='Page_168'></a>one who felt sincerer pleasure than I. Still holding the dear-loved child in my
arms, I asked my heart if these transports were not delusion. "How could
you," cried I, turning to Jenkinson, "how could you add to my miseries by
the story of her death? But it matters not: my pleasure at finding her
again is more than a recompense for the pain."</p>

<p class='c009'>"As to your question," replied Jenkinson, "that is easily answered. I
thought the only probable means of freeing you from prison, was by submitting
to the squire, and consenting to his marriage with the other young lady. But
these you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living; there
was, therefore, no other method to bring things to bear, but by persuading
you that she was dead. I prevailed on your wife to join in the deceit, and we
have not had a fit opportunity of undeceiving you till now."</p>

<p class='c009'>In the whole assembly there now appeared only two faces that did not
glow with transport. Mr. Thornhill's assurance had entirely forsaken him;
he now saw the gulf of infamy and want before him, and trembled to take the
plunge. He therefore fell on his knees before his uncle, and in a voice of
piercing misery implored compassion. Sir William was going to spurn him
away, but at my request he raised him, and after pausing a few moments,
"Thy vices, crimes, and ingratitude," cried he, "deserve no tenderness; yet
thou shalt not be entirely forsaken; a bare competence shall be supplied to
support the wants of life, but not its follies. This young lady, thy wife, shall
be put in possession of a third part of that fortune which once was thine; and
from her tenderness alone thou art to expect any extraordinary supplies for the
future." He was going to express his gratitude for such kindness in a set
speech; but the baronet prevented him, by bidding him not aggravate his
meanness, which was already but too apparent. He ordered him at the same
time to be gone, and from all his former domestics to choose one, and such as
he should think proper, which was all that should be granted to attend him.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as he left us, Sir William very politely stepped up to his new
niece with a smile, and wished her joy. His example was followed by Miss
Wilmot and her father; my wife too kissed her daughter with much affection,
as, to use her own expression, she was now made an honest woman of. Sophia
and Moses followed in turn, and even our benefactor Jenkinson desired to be
admitted to that honour. Our satisfaction seemed scarcely capable of increase.
Sir William, whose greatest pleasure was in doing good, now looked round
with a countenance open as the sun, and saw nothing but joy in the looks of
all except that of my daughter Sophia, who, for some reasons we could not
<a id='Page_169'></a>comprehend, did not seem perfectly satisfied. "I think now," cried he, with a
smile, "that all the company, except one or two, seem perfectly happy. There
only remains an act of justice for me to do. You are sensible, sir," continued
he, turning to me, "of the obligations we both owe to Mr. Jenkinson; and it
is but just we should both reward him for it. Miss Sophia will, I am sure,
make him very happy, and he shall have five hundred pounds as her fortune;
and upon this, I am sure, they can live very comfortably together. Come,
Miss Sophia, what say you to this match of my making? will you have him?"
My poor girl seemed almost sinking into her mother's arms at the hideous
proposal. "Have him, sir!" cried she, faintly; "no, sir, never!" "What!"
cried he again, "not Mr. Jenkinson, your benefactor; a handsome young
fellow, with five-hundred pounds and good expectations?" "I beg, sir,"
returned she, scarcely able to speak, "that you'll desist, and not make me so
very wretched." "Was ever such obstinacy known?" cried he again, "to
refuse the man whom the family has such infinite obligations to—who has preserved
your sister, and who has five hundred pounds? What! not have him!"
"No, sir, never," replied she, angrily; "I'd sooner die first!" "If that be
the case, then," cried he, "if you will not have him—I think I must have you
myself." And so saying, he caught her to his breast with ardour. "My
loveliest, my most sensible of girls," cried he, "how could you ever think your
own Burchell could deceive you, or that Sir William Thornhill could ever
cease to admire a mistress that loved him for himself alone? I have for some
years sought for a woman, who, a stranger to my fortune, could think I had
merit as a man. After having tried in vain, even among the pert and ugly,
how great at last must be my rapture, to have made a conquest over such
sense and such heavenly beauty!" Then turning to Jenkinson, "As I cannot,
sir, part with this young lady myself, for she has taken a fancy to the cut of
my face, all the recompense I can make is, to give you her fortune, and you
may call upon my steward to-morrow for five hundred pounds." Thus we had
all our compliments to repeat, and Lady Thornhill underwent the same round
of ceremony that her sister had done before. In the meantime Sir William's
gentleman appeared to tell us that the equipages were ready to carry us to the
inn, where everything was prepared for our reception. My wife and I led the
van, and left those gloomy mansions of sorrow. The generous baronet ordered
forty pounds to be distributed among the prisoners, and Mr. Wilmot, induced
by his example, gave half that sum. We were received below by the shouts
of the villagers, and I saw and shook by the hand two or three of my honest
<a id='Page_170'></a>parishioners, who were among the number. They attended us to our inn,
where a sumptuous entertainment was provided, and coarser provisions were
distributed in great quantities among the populace.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_171'></a>After supper, as my spirits were exhausted by the alternation of pleasure
and pain which they had sustained during the day, I asked permission to
withdraw; and leaving the company in the midst of their mirth, as soon as I
found myself alone, I poured out my heart in gratitude to the Giver of joy as
well as sorrow, and then slept undisturbed till morning.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>CHAPTER XXXII.</i><br /> <br /><i>The conclusion.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The next morning, as soon as I awaked, I found my eldest son sitting by my
bedside, who came to increase my joy with another turn of fortune in my
favour. First having released me from the settlement that I had made the day
before in his favour, he let me know that my merchant, who had failed in town,
was arrested at Antwerp, and there had given up effects to a much greater
amount than what was due to his creditors. My boy's generosity pleased me
almost as much as this unlooked-for good fortune. But I had some doubts
whether I ought in justice to accept his offer. While I was pondering upon
this, Sir William entered the room, to whom I communicated my doubts. His
opinion was, that as my son was already possessed of a very affluent fortune by
his marriage, I might accept his offer without hesitation. His business, however,
was to inform me that, as he had the night before sent for the licenses,
and expected them every hour, he hoped that I would not refuse my assistance
in making all the company happy that morning. A footman entered while we
were speaking, to tell us that the messenger was returned; and as I was by
this time ready, I went down, where I found the whole company as merry as
affluence and innocence could make them. However, as they were now preparing
for a very solemn ceremony, their laughter entirely displeased me. I
told them of the grave, becoming, and sublime deportment they should assume
upon this mystical occasion, and read them two homilies and a thesis of my
own composing, in order to prepare them. Yet they still seemed perfectly
refractory and ungovernable. Even as we were going along to church, to
which I led the way, all gravity had quite forsaken them, and I was often
tempted to turn back in indignation. In church a new dilemma arose, which
<a id='Page_172'></a>promised no easy solution. This was, which couple should be married first:
my son's bride warmly insisted that Lady Thornhill (that was to be) should
take the lead; but this the other refused with equal ardour, protesting she
would not be guilty of such rudeness for the world. The argument was supported
for some time between both with equal obstinacy and good breeding.
But as I stood all this time with my book ready, I was at last quite tired of
the contest, and shutting it, "I perceive," cried I, "that none of you have a
mind to be married, and I think we had as good go back again; for I suppose
there will be no business done here to-day." This is once reduced them to
reason. The baronet and his lady were first married, and then my son and
his lovely partner.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had previously that morning given orders that a coach should be sent for
my honest neighbour Flamborough and his family, by which means, upon our
return to the inn, we had the pleasure of finding the two Miss Flamboroughs
alighted before us. Mr. Jenkinson gave his hand to the eldest, and my son
Moses led up the other; and I have since found that he has taken a real liking
to the girl, and my consent and bounty he shall have, whenever he thinks
proper to demand them. We were no sooner returned to the inn, but numbers
of my parishioners, hearing of my success, came to congratulate me; but
among the rest were those who rose to rescue me, and whom I formerly
rebuked with such sharpness. I told the story to Sir William, my son-in-law,
who went out and reproved them with great severity; but, finding them quite
disheartened by his harsh reproof, he gave them half-a-guinea a-piece to drink
his health and raise their dejected spirits.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after this we were called to a very genteel entertainment, which was
dressed by Mr. Thornhill's cook. And it may not be improper to observe,
with respect to that gentleman, that he now resides in quality of companion at
a relation's house, being very well liked, and seldom sitting at the side-table,
except when there is no room at the other, for they make no stranger of him.
His time is pretty much taken up in keeping his relation, who is a little melancholy,
in spirits, and in learning to blow the French horn. My eldest daughter,
however, still remembers him with regret; and she has even told me, though I
make a great secret of it, that when he reforms she may be brought to relent.
But to return, for I am not apt to digress thus: when we were to sit down to
dinner our ceremonies were going to be renewed. The question was, whether
my eldest daughter, as being a matron, should not sit above the two young
brides; but the debate was cut short by my son George, who proposed that
<a id='Page_173'></a>the company should sit indiscriminately, every gentleman by his lady. This
was received with great approbation by all, excepting my wife, who, I could
perceive, was not perfectly satisfied, as she expected to have had the pleasure of
sitting at the head of the table, and carving all the meat for all the company.
But, notwithstanding this, it is impossible to describe our good-humour. I
can't say whether we had more wit among us now than usual, but I am certain
we had more laughing, which answered the end as well. One jest I particularly
remember: old Mr. Wilmot drinking to Moses, whose head was turned
another way, my son replied, "Madam, I thank you;" upon which the old
gentleman, winking upon the rest of the company, observed that he was thinking
of his mistress. At which jest I thought the two Miss Flamboroughs
would have died with laughing. As soon as dinner was over, according to my
old custom, I requested that the table might be taken away, to have the pleasure
of seeing all my family assembled once more by a cheerful fireside. My
two little ones sat upon each knee, the rest of the company by their partners.
I had nothing now on this side of the grave to wish for—all my cares were
over: my pleasure was unspeakable. It now only remained that my gratitude
in good fortune should exceed my former submission in adversity.</p>

    <div>TO THE REV. HENRY GOLDSMITH</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='c009'>I am sensible that the friendship between us can acquire no new force from the
ceremonies of a dedication; and perhaps it demands an excuse thus to prefix your
name to my attempts, which you decline giving with your own. But as a part of this
poem was formerly written to you from Switzerland, the whole can now, with propriety,
be only inscribed to you. It will also throw a light upon many parts of it, when the
reader understands that it is addressed to a man who, despising fame and fortune, has
retired early to happiness and obscurity, with an income of forty pounds a-year.</p>

<p class='c009'>I now perceive, my dear brother, the wisdom of your humble choice. You have
entered upon a sacred office, where the harvest is great, and the labourers are but few;
while you have left the field of ambition, where the labourers are many, and the
harvest not worth carrying away. But of all kinds of ambition—what from the
refinement of the times, from different systems of criticism, and from the divisions of
party—that which pursues poetical fame is the wildest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poetry makes a principal amusement among unpolished nations; but in a country
verging to the extremes of refinement, painting and music come in for a share. As
these offer the feeble mind a less laborious entertainment, they at first rival poetry,
and at length supplant her: they engross all that favour once shown to her, and,
though but younger sisters, seize upon the elder's birthright.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet, however this art may be neglected by the powerful, it is still in greater
danger from the mistaken efforts of the learned to improve it. What criticisms have
we not heard of late in favour of blank verse and Pindaric odes, choruses, anapests
and iambics, alliterative care and happy negligence! Every absurdity has now a
champion to defend it; and as he is generally much in the wrong, so he has always
much to say; for error is ever talkative.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there is an enemy to this art still more dangerous,—I mean Party. Party
entirely distorts the judgment and destroys the taste. When the mind is once
infected with this disease, it can only find pleasure in what contributes to increase the
distemper. Like the tiger, that seldom desists from pursuing man after having once
preyed upon human flesh, the reader who has once gratified his appetite with calumny,
makes, ever after, the most agreeable feast upon murdered reputation. Such readers
generally admire some half-witted thing, who wants to be thought a bold man, having
lost the character of a wise one. Him they dignify with the name of poet: his tawdry
lampoons are called satires; his turbulence is said to be force, and his frenzy fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>What reception a poem may find which has neither abuse, party, nor blank verse
to support it, I cannot tell, nor am I solicitous to know. My aims are right. Without
espousing the cause of any party, I have endeavoured to moderate the rage of all.
I have attempted to show, that there may be equal happiness in states that are
differently governed from our own; that every state has a particular principle of
happiness, and that this principle in each may be carried to a mischievous excess.
There are few can judge better than yourself how far these positions are illustrated in
this poem.</p>

      <div class='line'>Till, carried to excess in each domain,</div>

      <div class='line'>With venerable grandeur mark the scene.</div>

      <div class='line'>Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here vanity assumes her pert grimace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And trims her robes of frieze with copper lace;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer,</div>
      <div class='line'>To boast one splendid banquet once a year:</div>
      <div class='line'>The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor weighs the solid worth of self-applause.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To men of other minds my fancy flies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies;</div>
      <div class='line'>Methinks her patient sons before me stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the broad ocean leans against the land,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, sedulous to stop the coming tide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lift the tall rampire's artificial pride.</div>
      <div class='line'>Onward, methinks, and diligently slow,</div>
      <div class='line'>The firm-connected bulwark seems to grow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Spreads its long arms amidst the watery roar,</div>
      <div class='line'>Scoops out an empire, and usurps the shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>While the pent ocean, rising o'er the pile,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile;</div>
      <div class='line'>The slow canal, the yellow-blossom'd vale,</div>
      <div class='line'>The willow-tufted bank, the gliding sail,</div>
      <div class='line'>The crowded mart, the cultivated plain,—</div>
      <div class='line'>A new creation rescued from his reign.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus, while around the wave-subjected soil</div>
      <div class='line'>Impels the native to repeated toil,</div>
      <div class='line'>Industrious habits in each bosom reign,</div>
      <div class='line'>And industry begets a love of gain.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hence all the good from opulence that springs,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all those ills superfluous treasure brings,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are here display'd. Their much-loved wealth imparts</div>
      <div class='line'>Convenience, plenty, elegance, and arts:</div>
      <div class='line'>But view them closer, craft and fraud appear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even liberty itself is barter'd here:</div>
      <div class='line'>At gold's superior charms all freedom flies,</div>
      <div class='line'>The needy sell it, and the rich man buys;</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_186'></a>A land of tyrants, and a den of slaves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here wretches seek dishonourable graves,</div>
      <div class='line'>And calmly bent, to servitude conform,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm.</div>

      <div class='line'>Intent on high designs, a thoughtful band,</div>
      <div class='line'>By forms unfashion'd, fresh from Nature's hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fierce in their native hardiness of soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>True to imagined right, above control,</div>
      <div class='line'>While e'en the peasant boasts these rights to scan,</div>
      <div class='line'>And learns to venerate himself as man.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thine, Freedom, thine the blessings pictured here,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Too blest, indeed, were such without alloy,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, foster'd e'en by Freedom, ills annoy:</div>
      <div class='line'>That independence Britons prize too high</div>
      <div class='line'>Keeps man from man, and breaks the social tie;</div>
      <div class='line'>The self-dependent lordlings stand alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>All claims that bind and sweeten life unknown;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here by the bonds of nature feebly held,</div>
      <div class='line'>Minds combat minds, repelling and repell'd:</div>
      <div class='line'>Ferments arise, imprison'd factions roar,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Nor this the worst. As Nature's ties decay,</div>

      <div class='line'>Fictitious bonds, the bonds of wealth and law,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still gather strength and force unwilling awe.</div>

      <div class='line'>And talent sinks, and merit weeps unknown:</div>
      <div class='line'>Till time may come, when, stript of all her charms,</div>
      <div class='line'>The land of scholars, and the nurse of arms,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where noble stems transmit the patriot flame,</div>

      <div class='line'>And thou, fair Freedom, taught alike to feel</div>
      <div class='line'>The rabble's rage, and tyrant's angry steel;</div>

      <div class='line'>By proud contempt, or favour's fostering sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still may thy blooms the changeful clime endure,</div>
      <div class='line'>I only would repress them to secure:</div>
      <div class='line'>For just experience tells, in every soil,</div>
      <div class='line'>That those that think must govern those that toil;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all that Freedom's highest aims can reach,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is but to lay proportion'd loads on each.</div>

      <div class='line'>Where beasts with man divided empire claim,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the brown Indian marks with murderous aim;</div>
      <div class='line'>There, while above the giddy tempest flies,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all around distressful yells arise,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pensive exile, bending with his woe,</div>
      <div class='line'>To stop too fearful, and too faint to go,</div>
      <div class='line'>Casts a long look where England's glories shine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bids his bosom sympathise with mine.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Vain, very vain, my weary search to find</div>
      <div class='line'>That bliss which only centres in the mind:</div>
      <div class='line'>Why have I stray'd from pleasure and repose,</div>
      <div class='line'>To seek a good each government bestows?</div>
      <div class='line'>In every government, though terrors reign,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though tyrant kings or tyrant laws restrain,</div>
      <div class='line'>How small, of all that human hearts endure,</div>
      <div class='line'>That part which laws or kings can cause or cure!</div>
      <div class='line'>Still to ourselves in every place consign'd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our own felicity we make or find:</div>
      <div class='line'>With secret course, which no loud storms annoy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Glides the smooth current of domestic joy.</div>
      <div class='line'>The lifted axe, the agonising wheel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Luke's iron crown, and Damiens' bed of steel,</div>
      <div class='line'>To men remote from power but rarely known,</div>
      <div class='line'>Leave reason, faith, and conscience, all our own.</div>

    <div>DEDICATION.</div>
    <div class='c003'>TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='c009'>I can have no expectations, in an address of this kind, either to add to your
reputation or to establish my own. You can gain nothing from my admiration, as I
am ignorant of that art in which you are said to excel; and I may lose much by the
severity of your judgment, as few have a juster taste in poetry than you. Setting
interest therefore aside, to which I never paid much attention, I must be indulged at
present in following my affections. The only dedication I ever made was to my
brother, because I loved him better than most other men. He is since dead. Permit
me to inscribe this poem to you.</p>

<p class='c009'>How far you may be pleased with the versification and mere mechanical parts of
this attempt, I do not pretend to inquire; but I know you will object (and indeed
several of our best and wisest friends concur in the opinion), that the depopulation it
deplores is nowhere to be seen, and the disorders it laments are only to be found in
the poet's own imagination. To this I can scarcely make any other answer than
that I sincerely believe what I have written; that I have taken all possible pains in
my country excursions, for these four or five years past, to be certain of what I allege;
and that all my views and inquiries have led me to believe those miseries real which I
here attempt to display. But this is not the place to enter into an inquiry, whether
the country be depopulating or not; the discussion would take up much room, and I
should prove myself, at best, an indifferent politician, to tire the reader with a long
preface, when I want his unfatigued attention to a long poem.</p>

<p class='c009'>In regretting the depopulation of the country, I inveigh against the increase of
our luxuries; and here also I expect the shout of modern politicians against me. For
twenty or thirty years past, it has been the fashion to consider luxury as one of the
greatest national advantages, and all the wisdom of antiquity, in that particular, as
erroneous. Still, however, I must remain a professed ancient on that head, and
continue to think those luxuries prejudicial to states by which so many vices are
introduced, and so many kingdoms have been undone. Indeed, so much has been
poured out of late on the other side of the question, that, merely for the sake of
novelty and variety, one would sometimes wish to be in the right.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>I am, dear Sir,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c014'>Your sincere friend and ardent admirer,</div>
<div class='c014'>OLIVER GOLDSMITH.</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where health and plenty cheer'd the labouring swain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And parting summer's lingering blooms delay'd:</div>
      <div class='line'>Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seats of my youth, when every sport could please,</div>
      <div class='line'>How often have I loiter'd o'er thy green,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where humble happiness endear'd each scene!</div>
      <div class='line'>How often have I paused on every charm,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The shelter'd cot, the cultivated farm,</div>
      <div class='line'>The never-failing brook, the busy mill,</div>
      <div class='line'>The decent church that topp'd the neighbouring hill,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>For talking age and whispering lovers made!</div>
      <div class='line'>How often have I bless'd the coming day,</div>
      <div class='line'>When toil remitting lent its turn to play,</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_192'></a>And all the village train, from labour free,</div>
      <div class='line'>Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree;</div>
      <div class='line'>While many a pastime circled in the shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>The young contending as the old survey'd;</div>
      <div class='line'>And many a gambol frolick'd o'er the ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sleights of art and feats of strength went round;</div>
      <div class='line'>And still as each repeated pleasure tired,</div>
      <div class='line'>Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired:</div>
      <div class='line'>The dancing pair that simply sought renown,</div>
      <div class='line'>By holding out to tire each other down;</div>
      <div class='line'>The swain, mistrustless of his smutted face,</div>
      <div class='line'>While secret laughter titter'd round the place;</div>
      <div class='line'>The bashful virgin's sidelong looks of love,</div>
      <div class='line'>The matron's glance that would those looks reprove.</div>
      <div class='line'>These were thy charms, sweet village! sports like these,</div>
      <div class='line'>With sweet succession, taught e'en toil to please;</div>
      <div class='line'>These round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed,</div>
      <div class='line'>These were thy charms—but all these charms are fled.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn;</div>
      <div class='line'>Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And desolation saddens all thy green:</div>
      <div class='line'>One only master grasps the whole domain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain;</div>
      <div class='line'>No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, choked with sedges, works its weedy way;</div>
      <div class='line'>Along thy glades a solitary guest,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;</div>
      <div class='line'>Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tires their echoes with unvaried cries.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the long grass o'ertops the mouldering wall;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Far, far away, thy children leave the land.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:</div>
      <div class='line'>Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade—</div>
      <div class='line'>A breath can make them, as a breath has made—</div>
      <div class='line'>But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A time there was, ere England's griefs began,</div>
      <div class='line'>When every rood of ground maintain'd its man:</div>
      <div class='line'>For him light labour spread her wholesome store,</div>
      <div class='line'>Just gave what life required, but gave no more:</div>
      <div class='line'>His best companions, innocence and health,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his best riches, ignorance of wealth.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><a id='Page_193'></a>But times are alter'd; trade's unfeeling train</div>
      <div class='line'>Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain:</div>
      <div class='line'>Along the lawn where scatter'd hamlets rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose;</div>
      <div class='line'>And every want to luxury allied,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every pang that folly pays to pride.</div>
      <div class='line'>Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,</div>
      <div class='line'>Those calm desires that ask'd but little room,</div>
      <div class='line'>Those healthful sports that graced the peaceful scene,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lived in each look, and brighten'd all the green,</div>
      <div class='line'>These, far departing, seek a kinder shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And rural mirth and manners are no more.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sweet Auburn! parent of the blissful hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's power.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, as I take my solitary rounds</div>
      <div class='line'>Amidst thy tangling walks and ruin'd grounds,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, many a year elapsed, return to view</div>
      <div class='line'>Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Remembrance wakes, with all her busy train,</div>
      <div class='line'>Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In all my wanderings round this world of care,</div>
      <div class='line'>In all my griefs—and God has given my share—</div>
      <div class='line'>I still had hopes my latest hours to crown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;</div>
      <div class='line'>To husband out life's taper at the close,</div>
      <div class='line'>And keep the flame from wasting by repose:</div>
      <div class='line'>I still had hopes,—for pride attends us still,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Amidst the swains to show my book-learn'd skill;</div>
      <div class='line'>Around my fire an evening group to draw,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tell of all I felt, and all I saw;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pants to the place from whence at first he flew,</div>
      <div class='line'>I still had hopes, my long vexations past,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here to return—and die at home at last.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>O blest retirement, friend to life's decline,</div>
      <div class='line'>Retreats from care, that never must be mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>How blest is he who crowns, in shades like these,</div>
      <div class='line'>A youth of labour with an age of ease;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who quits a world where strong temptations try,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, since 'tis hard to combat, learns to fly!</div>

      <div class='line'>While resignation gently slopes the way;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, all his prospects brightening to the last,</div>
      <div class='line'>His heaven commences ere the world be past.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sweet was the sound, when oft, at evening's close,</div>
      <div class='line'>Up yonder hill the village murmur rose;</div>
      <div class='line'>There, as I pass'd with careless steps and slow,</div>
      <div class='line'>The mingling notes came soften'd from below:</div>
      <div class='line'>The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sober herd that low'd to meet their young;</div>
      <div class='line'>The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool,</div>
      <div class='line'>The playful children just let loose from school;</div>
      <div class='line'>The watch-dog's voice, that bay'd the whispering wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fill'd each pause the nightingale had made.</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_195'></a>But now the sounds of population fail,</div>
      <div class='line'>No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale;</div>
      <div class='line'>No busy steps the grass-grown footway tread,</div>
      <div class='line'>But all the bloomy flush of life is fled:</div>
      <div class='line'>All but yon widow'd, solitary thing,</div>
      <div class='line'>That feebly bends beside the plashy spring;</div>
      <div class='line'>She, wretched matron! forced in age, for bread,</div>
      <div class='line'>To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,</div>
      <div class='line'>To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,</div>
      <div class='line'>To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn;</div>
      <div class='line'>She only left of all the harmless train,</div>
      <div class='line'>The said historian of the pensive plain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Near yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,</div>
      <div class='line'>And still where many a garden flower grows wild,</div>
      <div class='line'>There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,</div>
      <div class='line'>The village preacher's modest mansion rose.</div>
      <div class='line'>A man he was to all the country dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And passing rich with forty pounds a year;</div>
      <div class='line'>Remote from towns he ran his godly race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor e'er had changed, nor wished to change, his place;</div>
      <div class='line'>Unskilful he to fawn, or seek for power</div>
      <div class='line'>By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour;</div>
      <div class='line'>Far other aims his heart had learnt to prize,</div>
      <div class='line'>More bent to raise the wretched than to rise.</div>
      <div class='line'>His house was known to all the vagrant train;</div>
      <div class='line'>He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain:</div>
      <div class='line'>The long-remember'd beggar was his guest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;</div>
      <div class='line'>The ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud,</div>
      <div class='line'>Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'd;</div>
      <div class='line'>The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sat by his fire, and talk'd the night away;</div>
      <div class='line'>Wept o'er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shoulder'd his crutch, and show'd how fields were won.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleased with his guests, the good man learn'd to glow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And quite forgot their vices in their woe;</div>
      <div class='line'>Careless their merits or their faults to scan,</div>
      <div class='line'>His pity gave ere charity began.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And e'en his failings lean'd to virtue's side;</div>
      <div class='line'>But in his duty prompt at every call,</div>
      <div class='line'>He watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt for all;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as a bird each fond endearment tries</div>
      <div class='line'>To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,</div>
      <div class='line'>He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><a id='Page_196'></a>Beside the bed where parting life was laid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd,</div>
      <div class='line'>The reverend champion stood. At his control</div>
      <div class='line'>Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;</div>
      <div class='line'>Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his last faltering accents whisper'd praise.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At church, with meek and unaffected grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>His looks adorn'd the venerable place;</div>
      <div class='line'>Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fools, who came to scoff, remain'd to pray.</div>
      <div class='line'>The service past, around the pious man,</div>
      <div class='line'>With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;</div>
      <div class='line'>E'en children follow'd with endearing wile,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile.</div>
      <div class='line'>His ready smile a parent's warmth express'd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distress'd;</div>
      <div class='line'>To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,</div>
      <div class='line'>But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.</div>
      <div class='line'>As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,</div>
      <div class='line'>Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,</div>
      <div class='line'>Eternal sunshine settles on its head.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Beside yon straggling fence, that skirts the way</div>
      <div class='line'>With blossom'd furze unprofitably gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,</div>
      <div class='line'>The village master taught his little school:</div>
      <div class='line'>A man severe he was, and stern to view,—</div>
      <div class='line'>I knew him well, and every truant knew;</div>
      <div class='line'>Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace</div>
      <div class='line'>The day's disasters in his morning face;</div>
      <div class='line'>Full well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee</div>
      <div class='line'>At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;</div>
      <div class='line'>Full well the busy whisper circling round,</div>
      <div class='line'>Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd:</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught,</div>
      <div class='line'>The love he bore to learning was in fault.</div>
      <div class='line'>The village all declared how much he knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too;</div>
      <div class='line'>Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,</div>
      <div class='line'>And e'en the story ran—that he could gauge:</div>
      <div class='line'>In arguing, too, the parson own'd his skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>For e'en though vanquish'd, he could argue still;</div>
      <div class='line'>While words of learned length and thundering sound</div>
      <div class='line'>Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;</div>
      <div class='line'>And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew</div>
      <div class='line'>That one small head could carry all he knew.</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_197'></a>But past is all his fame. The very spot</div>
      <div class='line'>Where many a time he triumph'd is forgot.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspired,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where grey-beard mirth, and smiling toil retired,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where village statesmen talk'd with looks profound,</div>
      <div class='line'>And news much older than their ale went round.</div>
      <div class='line'>Imagination fondly stoops to trace</div>
      <div class='line'>The parlour splendours of that festive place:</div>
      <div class='line'>The white-wash'd wall, the nicely sanded floor;</div>
      <div class='line'>The varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door;</div>
      <div class='line'>The chest contrived a double debt to pay,</div>
      <div class='line'>A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;</div>
      <div class='line'>The pictures placed for ornament and use;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Twelve Good Rules, the royal game of goose;</div>
      <div class='line'>The hearth, except when winter chill'd the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay;</div>
      <div class='line'>While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for show,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ranged o'er the chimney, glisten'd in a row.</div>
      <div class='line'>Vain transitory splendours! could not all</div>
      <div class='line'>Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall?</div>
      <div class='line'>Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart</div>
      <div class='line'>An hour's importance to the poor man's heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thither no more the peasant shall repair,</div>
      <div class='line'>To sweet oblivion of his daily care;</div>
      <div class='line'>No more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,</div>
      <div class='line'>No more the woodman's ballad shall prevail;</div>
      <div class='line'>No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Relax his ponderous strength, and learn to hear:</div>
      <div class='line'>The host himself no longer shall be found</div>
      <div class='line'>Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor the coy maid, half willing to be press'd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,</div>
      <div class='line'>These simple blessings of the lowly train;</div>
      <div class='line'>To me more dear, congenial to my heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>One native charm, than all the gloss of art.</div>
      <div class='line'>Spontaneous joys, where nature has its play,</div>
      <div class='line'>The soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;</div>
      <div class='line'>Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unenvied, unmolested, unconfined.</div>
      <div class='line'>But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all the freaks of wanton wealth array'd,</div>
      <div class='line'>In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,</div>
      <div class='line'>The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;</div>

      <div class='line'>Slights every borrow'd charm that dress supplies,</div>

      <div class='line'>And half the business of destruction done;</div>
      <div class='line'>E'en now, methinks, as pondering here I stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>I see the rural virtues leave the land.</div>
      <div class='line'>Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail,</div>
      <div class='line'>That idly waiting flaps with every gale,</div>
      <div class='line'>Downward they move, a melancholy band,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pass from the shore, and darken all the strand.</div>
      <div class='line'>Contented toil, and hospitable care,</div>
      <div class='line'>And kind connubial tenderness, are there;</div>

  <h2 class='c007'>THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.<br /> <br />A POETICAL EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.</h2>
</div>
<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thanks, my Lord, for your Ven'son; for finer or fatter,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ne'er ranged in a forest or smoked in a platter.</div>
      <div class='line'>The haunch was a picture for painters to study,</div>
      <div class='line'>The fat was so white, and the lean was so ruddy;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though my stomach was sharp, I could scarce help regretting</div>
      <div class='line'>To spoil such a delicate picture by eating:</div>
      <div class='line'>I had thoughts in my chamber to place it in view,</div>
      <div class='line'>To be shown to my friends as a piece of virtù;</div>
      <div class='line'>As in some Irish houses, where things are so-so,</div>
      <div class='line'>One gammon of bacon hangs up for a show;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, for eating a rasher of what they take pride in,</div>
      <div class='line'>They'd as soon think of eating the pan it is fried in.</div>
      <div class='line'>But hold—let me pause—Don't I hear you pronounce</div>
      <div class='line'>This tale of the bacon's a damnable bounce?</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_204'></a>Well! suppose it a bounce—sure a poet may try,</div>
      <div class='line'>By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, my lord, it's no bounce: I protest in my turn,</div>
      <div class='line'>It's a truth—and your lordship may ask Mr. Burn.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line in2'>To go on with my tale—as I gazed on the Haunch,</div>
      <div class='line'>I thought of a friend that was trusty and staunch;</div>
      <div class='line'>So I cut it, and sent it to Reynolds undrest,</div>
      <div class='line'>To paint it, or eat it, just as he liked best.</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the neck and the breast I had next to dispose—</div>
      <div class='line'>'Twas a neck and a breast that might rival Monroe's:</div>
      <div class='line'>But in parting with these I was puzzled again,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the how, and the who, and the where, and the when.</div>
      <div class='line'>There's H—d, and C—y, and H—rth, and H—ff,</div>
      <div class='line'>I think they love ven'son—I know they love beef;</div>
      <div class='line'>There's my countryman, Higgins—Oh! let him alone</div>
      <div class='line'>For making a blunder, or picking a bone.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, hang it! to poets, who seldom can eat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Your very good mutton's a very good treat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such dainties to them their health it might hurt;</div>
      <div class='line'>It's like sending them ruffles when wanting a shirt.</div>
      <div class='line'>While thus I debated, in reverie centred,</div>
      <div class='line'>An acquaintance—a friend as he call'd himself—enter'd:</div>
      <div class='line'>An under-bred, fine-spoken fellow was he;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he smiled as he look'd at the Ven'son and me.</div>
      <div class='line'>"What have we got here?—Why, this is good eating!</div>
      <div class='line'>Your own, I suppose—or is it in waiting?"</div>
      <div class='line'>"Why, whose should it be?" cried I, with a flounce;</div>
      <div class='line'>"I get these things often"—but that was a bounce:</div>
      <div class='line'>"Some lords, my acquaintance, that settle the nation,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are pleased to be kind—but I hate ostentation."</div>
      <div class='line'>"If that be the case then," cried he, very gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>"I'm glad I have taken this house in my way.</div>
      <div class='line'>To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me;</div>
      <div class='line'>No words—I insist on't—precisely at three:</div>
      <div class='line'>We'll have Johnson and Burke; all the wits will be there;</div>
      <div class='line'>My acquaintance is slight or I'd ask my Lord Clare.</div>
      <div class='line'>And, now that I think on't, as I am a sinner!</div>
      <div class='line'>We wanted this Ven'son to make out a dinner.</div>
      <div class='line'>What say you—a pasty?—it shall, and it must,</div>
      <div class='line'>And my wife, little Kitty, is famous for crust.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, porter!—this Ven'son with me to Mile-end;</div>
      <div class='line'>No stirring, I beg,—my dear friend—my dear friend!"</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus, snatching his hat, he brush'd off like the wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the porter and eatables follow'd behind.</div>
    </div>

      <div class='line'>Though I could not help thinking my gentleman hasty,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet Johnson, and Burke, and a good ven'son pasty,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were things that I never disliked in my life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though clogg'd with a coxcomb, and Kitty his wife.</div>
      <div class='line'>So next day, in due splendour to make my approach,</div>
      <div class='line'>I drove to his door in my own hackney-coach.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When come to the place where we all were to dine,</div>
      <div class='line'>(A chair-lumber'd closet, just twelve feet by nine,)</div>
      <div class='line'>My friend bade me welcome, but struck me quite dumb</div>
      <div class='line'>With tidings that Johnson and Burke would not come.</div>
      <div class='line'>"For I knew it," he cried; "both eternally fail,</div>
      <div class='line'>The one with his speeches, and t'other with Thrale.</div>
      <div class='line'>But no matter, I'll warrant we'll make up the party</div>
      <div class='line'>With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty.</div>
      <div class='line'>The one is a Scotchman, the other a Jew;</div>
      <div class='line'>They're both of them merry, and authors like you.</div>
      <div class='line'>The one writes the 'Snarler,' the other the 'Scourge:'</div>
      <div class='line'>Some think he writes 'Cinna'—he owns to 'Panurge.'"</div>
      <div class='line'>While thus he described them by trade and by name,</div>
      <div class='line'>They entered, and dinner was served as they came.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At the top a fried liver and bacon were seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>At the bottom was tripe in a swingeing tureen;</div>
      <div class='line'>At the sides there was spinach and pudding made hot;</div>
      <div class='line'>In the middle a place where the Pasty—was not.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, my Lord, as for tripe, it's my utter aversion,</div>
      <div class='line'>And your bacon I hate like a Turk or a Persian;</div>
      <div class='line'>So there I sat stuck like a horse in a pound,</div>
      <div class='line'>While the bacon and liver went merrily round:</div>
      <div class='line'>But what vexed me most was that d——d Scottish rogue,</div>
      <div class='line'>With his long-winded speeches, his smiles, and his brogue;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, "Madam," quoth he, "may this bit be my poison,</div>
      <div class='line'>A prettier dinner I never set eyes on!</div>
      <div class='line'>Pray, a slice of your liver, though, may I be curst,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I've eat of your tripe till I'm ready to burst."</div>
      <div class='line'>"The tripe!" quoth the Jew, with his chocolate cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>"I could dine on this tripe seven days in a week;</div>
      <div class='line'>I like these here dinners, so pretty and small:</div>
      <div class='line'>But your friend there, the Doctor, eats nothing at all."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Oho!" quoth my friend, "he'll come on in a trice:</div>
      <div class='line'>He's keeping a corner for something that's nice;</div>
      <div class='line'>There's a Pasty"—"A Pasty!" repeated the Jew,</div>
      <div class='line'>"I don't care if I keep a corner for't too."</div>

    <div class='c003'>A POEM.</div>
    <div class='c002'>FIRST PRINTED IN MDCCLXXIV., AFTER THE AUTHOR'S DEATH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Dr. Goldsmith and some of his friends occasionally dined at the
St. James's Coffee-house. One day it was proposed to write epitaphs
on him. His country, dialect, and person furnished subjects of
witticism. He was called on for retaliation, and at their next
meeting produced the following poem.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>

      <div class='line'>To make out the dinner, full certain I am</div>
      <div class='line'>That Ridge<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> is anchovy, and Reynolds<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a> is lamb;</div>

      <div class='line'>At a dinner so various—at such a repast</div>
      <div class='line'>Who'd not be a glutton, and stick to the last?</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, waiter, more wine! let me sit while I'm able,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till all my companions sink under the table,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, with chaos and blunders encircling my head,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let me ponder, and tell what I think of the dead.</div>

      <div class='line'>Perhaps you may ask if the man was a miser?</div>

      <div class='line'>His very worst foe can't accuse him of that.</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps he confided in men as they go,</div>

      <div class='line'>Then what was his failing? come, tell it, and burn ye!</div>

      <div class='line'>He has not left a wiser or better behind;</div>

      <div class='line'>His manners were gentle, complying, and bland;</div>
      <div class='line'>Still born to improve us in every part,</div>

      <div class='line'>To coxcombs averse, yet most civilly steering,</div>
      <div class='line'>When they judged without skill, he was still hard of hearing:</div>

      <div class='line'>While all their hours were pass'd between</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Thus, as her faults each day were known,</div>
      <div class='line'>He thinks her features coarser grown;</div>

      <div class='line'>Whenever rage or envy rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>How wide her mouth, how wild her eyes!</div>
      <div class='line'>He knows not how, but so it is,</div>

      <div class='line'>But where's this place, this storehouse of the age?</div>
      <div class='line'>The Moon, says he;—but I affirm, the Stage—</div>
      <div class='line'>At least, in many things, I think I see</div>
      <div class='line'>His lunar and our mimic world agree:</div>

      <div class='line'>But in this parallel my best pretence is,</div>

      <div class='line'>To this strange spot, rakes, macaronies, cits,</div>
      <div class='line'>Come thronging to collect their scatter'd wits.</div>
      <div class='line'>The gay coquette, who ogles all the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Comes here at night, and goes a prude away.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hither the affected city dame advancing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who sighs for operas, and doats on dancing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Taught by our art, her ridicule to pause on,</div>

      <div class='line'>Oft risks his fortune on one desperate throw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Comes here to saunter, having made his bets,</div>
      <div class='line'>Finds his lost senses out, and pays his debts.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Mohawk, too, with angry phrases stor'd—</div>
      <div class='line'>As "Dam'me, Sir!" and, "Sir, I wear a sword!"</div>
      <div class='line'>Here lesson'd for awhile, and hence retreating,</div>
      <div class='line'>Goes out, affronts his man, and takes a beating.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here come the sons of scandal and of news,</div>
      <div class='line'>But find no sense—for they had none to lose.</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the tribe here wanting an adviser,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our Author's the least likely to grow wiser;</div>
      <div class='line'>Has he not seen how you your favour place</div>
      <div class='line'>On sentimental queens and lords in lace?</div>
      <div class='line'>Without a star, a coronet, or garter,</div>
      <div class='line'>How can the piece expect or hope for quarter?</div>
      <div class='line'>No high-life scenes, no sentiment:—the creature</div>

      <div class='line'>In book the second, page the tenth:</div>

      <div class='line'>By classic authors termed Caduceus,</div>

      <div class='line'>For let folks only get a touch,</div>
      <div class='line'>Its soporific virtue's such,</div>

      <div class='line'>His frothy slaver, venom'd bites:</div>
      <div class='line'>An equal semblance still to keep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Alike, too, both conduce to sleep;</div>
      <div class='line'>This difference only,—as the god</div>

      <div class='line'>"We have our exits and our entrances."</div>

      <div class='line'>Blushes when hired, and, with unmeaning action,</div>
      <div class='line'>"I hopes as how to give you satisfaction."</div>
      <div class='line'>Her second act displays a livelier scene,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The unblushing bar-maid of a country inn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who whisks about the house, at market caters,</div>
      <div class='line'>Talks loud, coquets the guests, and scolds the waiters.</div>
      <div class='line'>Next the scene shifts to town, and there she soars,</div>
      <div class='line'>The chop-house toast of ogling <i>connoisseurs</i>:</div>
      <div class='line'>On 'squires and cits she there displays her arts,</div>
      <div class='line'>And on the gridiron broils her lovers' hearts;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as she smiles, her triumphs to complete,</div>
      <div class='line'>E'en common-councilmen forget to eat.</div>
      <div class='line'>The fourth act shows her wedded to the 'squire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And madam now begins to hold it higher;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pretends to taste, at operas cries <i>caro!</i></div>
      <div class='line'>And quits her Nancy Dawson for Che Faro:</div>
      <div class='line'>Doats upon dancing, and, in all her pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Swims round the room, the Heinelle of Cheapside;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ogles and leers with artificial skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till, having lost in age the power to kill,</div>
      <div class='line'>She sits all night at cards, and ogles at spadille.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such through our lives the eventful history—</div>
      <div class='line'>The fifth and last act still remains for me:</div>

      <div class='line'>Our author's friends, thus placed at happy distance,</div>

      <div class='line'>As some unhappy wight, at some new play,</div>

      <div class='line'>His simpering friends, with pleasure in their eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sink as he sinks, and as he rises rise:</div>
      <div class='line'>He nods, they nod; he cringes, they grimace;</div>
      <div class='line'>But not a soul will budge to give him place.</div>
      <div class='line'>Since, then, unhelp'd, our bard must now conform</div>

    <div>PREFACE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>When I undertook to write a comedy, I confess I was strongly
prepossessed in favour of the poets of the last age, and strove
to imitate them. The term <i>genteel comedy</i> was then unknown amongst
us, and little more was desired by an audience, than nature and
humour, in whatever walks of life they were most conspicuous. The
author of the following scenes never imagined that more would be
expected of him, and therefore to delineate character has been his
principal aim. Those who know any thing of composition, are sensible,
that in pursuing humour, it will sometimes lead us into the recesses
of the mean; I was even tempted to look for it in the master of a
spunging-house: but in deference to the public taste, grown of late,
perhaps, too delicate, the scene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the
representation. In deference also to the judgment of a few friends,
who think in a particular way, the scene is here restored. The author
submits it to the reader in his closet; and hopes that too much
refinement will not banish humour and character from ours, as it has
already done from the French theatre. Indeed the French comedy is now
become so very elevated and sentimental, that it has not only banished
humour and <i>Molière</i> from the stage, but it has banished all
spectators too.</p>

<p class='c016'>Upon the whole, the author returns his thanks to the public for the
favourable reception which the Good-Natured Man has met with: and to
Mr. Colman in particular, for his kindness to it. It may not also be
improper to assure any who shall hereafter write for the theatre,
that merit, or supposed merit, will ever be a sufficient passport
to his protection.</p>

</div>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Scene I.</span>—<i>An Apartment in</i> <span class='sc'>Young Honeywood's</span> <i>House</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Sir William Honeywood</span> <i>and</i>
<span class='sc'>Jarvis</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Good Jarvis, make no
apologies for this honest bluntness.
Fidelity like yours, is the best excuse
for every freedom.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> I can't help being blunt, and
being very angry too, when I hear
you talk of disinheriting so good, so
worthy a young gentleman as your
nephew, my master. All the world
loves him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Say rather, that he loves
all the world; that is his fault.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> I'm sure there is no part of
it more dear to him than you are,
though he has not seen you since he
was a child.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> What signifies his affection
to me? or how can I be proud of
a place in a heart where every sharper
and coxcomb finds an easy entrance?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> I grant that he's rather too
good-natured; that he's too much every
<a id='Page_290'></a>man's man; that he laughs this minute
with one, and cries the next with
another; but whose instructions may
he thank for all this?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Not mine, sure! My letters
to him during my employment in
Italy, taught him only that philosophy
which might prevent, not defend, his
errors.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Faith, begging your honour's
pardon, I'm sorry they taught him any
philosophy at all; it has only served
to spoil him. This same philosophy
is a good horse in a stable, but an
errant jade on a journey. For my own
part, whenever I hear him mention
the name on't, I'm always sure he's
going to play the fool.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Don't let us ascribe his
faults to his philosophy, I entreat you.
No, Jarvis, his good-nature arises rather
from his fears of offending the importunate,
than his desire of making the
deserving happy.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> What it rises from, I don't
know. But, to be sure, every body
has it, that asks it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Ay, or that does not ask
it. I have been now for some time a
concealed spectator of his follies, and
find them as boundless as his dissipation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> And yet, faith, he has some
fine name or other for them all. He
call his extravagance, generosity; and
his trusting every body, universal benevolence.
It was but last week he
went security for a fellow whose face
he scarce knew, and that he called an
act of exalted mu-mu-munificence;
ay, that was the name he gave it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> And upon that I proceed,
as my last effort, though with very
little hopes to reclaim him. That very
fellow has just absconded, and I have
taken up the security. Now, my intention
<a id='Page_291'></a>is, to involve him in fictitious distress,
before he has plunged himself
into real calamity; to arrest him for
that very debt, to clap an officer upon
him, and then let him see which of
his friends will come to his relief.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Well, if I could but any way
see him thoroughly vexed, every groan
of his would be music to me; yet,
faith, I believe it impossible. I have
tried to fret him myself every morning
these three years; but, instead of being
angry, he sits as calmly to hear
me scold, as he does to his hair-dresser.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> We must try him once
more, however, and I'll go this instant
to put my scheme into execution; and
I don't despair of succeeding, as by
your means, I can have frequent opportunities
of being about him, without
being known. What a pity it is,
Jarvis, that any man's good will to
others should produce so much neglect
of himself, as to require correction!
Yet, we must touch his weakness with
a delicate hand. There are some faults
so nearly allied to excellence, that we
can scarce weed out the vice without
eradicating the virtue.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div><i>Exit.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Well, go thy ways, Sir
William Honeywood. It is not without
reason that the world allows thee
to be the best of men. But here
comes his hopeful nephew; the strange,
good-natured, foolish, open-hearted—And
yet, all his faults are such that
one loves him still the better for them.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Honeywood</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Well, Jarvis, what messages
from my friends this morning!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> You have no friends.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Well; from my acquaintance,
then?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> (<i>Pulling out bills.</i>) A few
of our usual cards of compliment,
<a id='Page_292'></a>that's all. This bill from your tailor;
this from your mercer; and this from
the little broker in Crooked-lane. He
says he has been at a great deal of
trouble to get back the money you
borrowed.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> That I don't know; but
I am sure we were at a great deal of
trouble in getting him to lend it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> He has lost all patience.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Then he has lost a very
good thing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> There's that ten guineas
you were sending to the poor gentleman
and his children in the Fleet.
I believe that would stop his mouth
for a while at least.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Ay, Jarvis, but what will
fill their mouths in the meantime?
Must I be cruel because he happens
to be importunate; and, to relieve his
avarice, leave them to insupportable
distress?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> 'Sdeath, sir, the question
now is, how to relieve yourself. Yourself—Haven't
I reason to be out of
my senses, when I see things going at
sixes and sevens?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Whatever reason you may
have for being out of your senses,
I hope you'll allow that I'm not quite
unreasonable for continuing in mine.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> You're the only man alive
in your present situation that could
do so—Every thing upon the waste.
There's Miss Richland and her fine
fortune gone already, and upon the
point of being given to your rival.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I'm no man's rival.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Your uncle in Italy preparing
to disinherit you; your own
fortune almost spent; and nothing but
pressing creditors, false friends, and a
pack of drunken servants that your
kindness has made unfit for any other
family.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_293'></a><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Then they have the more
occasion for being in mine.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> So! What will you have
done with him that I caught stealing
your plate in the pantry? In the fact;
I caught him in the fact.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> In the fact? If so, I
really think that we should pay him
his wages, and turn him off.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> He shall be turned off at
Tyburn, the dog; we'll hang him, if
it be only to frighten the rest of the
family.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> No, Jarvis: it's enough
that we have lost what he has stolen,
let us not add to the loss of a fellow-creature.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Very fine; well, here was
the footman just now, to complain of
the butler; he says he does most
work, and ought to have most
wages.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> That's but just: though
perhaps here comes the butler to complain
of the footman.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Ay, it's the way with them
all, from the scullion to the privy-counsellor.
If they have a bad master,
they keep quarrelling with him; if
they have a good master they keep
quarrelling with one another.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Butler</span> <i>drunk</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Butler.</span> Sir, I'll not stay in the
family with Jonathan: you must part
with him, or part with me, that's the
ex-ex-position of the matter, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Full and explicit enough.
But what's his fault, good Phillip?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Butler.</span> Sir, he's given to drinking,
sir, and I shall have my morals corrupted,
by keeping such company.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Ha! ha! he has such a
diverting way—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> O! quite amusing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Butler.</span> I find my wines a-going,
<a id='Page_294'></a>sir; and liquors don't go without
mouths, sir; I hate a drunkard, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Well, well, Philip, I'll
hear you upon that another time, so go
to bed now.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> To bed! Let him go to the
devil.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Butler.</span> Begging your honour's
pardon, and begging your pardon,
master Jarvis, I'll not go to bed, nor
to the devil neither. I have enough to
do to mind my cellar. I forgot, your
honour, Mr. Croaker is below. I came
on purpose to tell you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Why didn't you show
him up, blockhead?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Butler.</span> Show him up, sir? With
all my heart, sir. Up or down, all's
one to me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div><i>Exit.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Ay, we have one or other
of that family in this house from
morning till night. He comes on the
old affair, I suppose; the match between
his son, that's just returned
from Paris, and Miss Richland, the
young lady he's guardian to.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Perhaps so. Mr. Croaker,
knowing my friendship for the young
lady, has got it into his head that I can
persuade her to what I please.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Ah! if you loved yourself
but half as well as she loves you, we
should soon see a marriage that would
set all things to rights again.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Love me! Sure, Jarvis,
you dream. No, no; her intimacy
with me never amounted to more than
friendship—mere friendship. That she
is the most lovely woman that ever
warmed the human heart with desire,
I own. But never let me harbour a
thought of making her unhappy, by a
connection with one so unworthy her
merits, as I am. No, Jarvis, it shall be
my study to serve her, even in spite
of my wishes; and to secure her
<a id='Page_295'></a>happiness, though it destroys my own.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Was ever the like? I want
patience.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Besides, Jarvis, though I
could obtain Miss Richland's consent,
do you think I could succeed with her
guardian, or Mrs. Croaker, his wife;
who, though both very fine in their
way, are yet a little opposite in their
dispositions, you know?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Opposite enough, Heaven
knows; the very reverse of each other;
she all laugh and no joke, he always
complaining and never sorrowful; a
fretful poor soul, that has a new distress
for every hour in the four-and-twenty—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Hush, hush, he's coming
up! he'll hear you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> One whose voice is a passing
bell—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Well, well, go do.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> A raven that bodes nothing
but mischief; a coffin and cross bones;
a bundle of rue; a sprig of deadly
nightshade; a—(<span class='sc'>Honeywood</span>, <i>stopping
his mouth, at last pushes him off</i>.)</p>

    <div><i>Exit</i> <span class='sc'>Jarvis</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I must own, my old
monitor is not entirely wrong. There
is something in my friend Croaker's
conversation that quite depresses me.
His very mirth is an antidote to all
gaiety, and his appearance has a
stronger effect on my spirits than an
undertaker's shop.—Mr. Croaker, this
is such a satisfaction—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Croaker</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> A pleasant morning to
Mr. Honeywood, and many of them.
How is this? You look most shockingly
to-day, my dear friend. I hope
this weather does not affect your spirits.
To be sure, if this weather continues—I
say nothing—but God send we
be all better this day three months.</p>

<p>"<span class='sc'>Croaker.</span>—<i>A pleasant morning to Mr. Honeywood.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 272.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I heartily concur in the
wish, though, I own, not in your
apprehensions.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> May be not. Indeed,
what signifies what weather we have,
in a country going to ruin like ours?
Taxes rising and trade falling. Money
flying out of the kingdom, and Jesuits
<a id='Page_297'></a>swarming into it. I know at this time
no less than a hundred and twenty-seven
Jesuits between Charing-cross
and Temple-bar.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> The Jesuits will scarce
pervert you or me, I should hope?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> May be not. Indeed
what signifies whom they pervert in a
country that has scarce any religion to
lose? I'm only afraid for our wives
and daughters.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I have no apprehensions
for the ladies, I assure you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> May be not. Indeed what
signifies whether they be perverted or
not? The women in my time were
good for something. I have seen a
lady dressed from top to toe in her own
manufactures formerly. But now-a-days
the devil a thing of their own manufacture
about them, except their faces.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> But, however these faults
may be practised abroad, you don't
find them at home, either with Mrs.
Croaker, Olivia, or Miss Richland.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> The best of them will
never be canonised for a saint when
she's dead. By the by, my dear
friend, I don't find this match between
Miss Richland and my son much relished,
either by one side or t'other.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I thought otherwise.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Ah, Mr. Honeywood, a
little of your fine serious advice to the
young lady might go far: I know she
has a very exalted opinion of your
understanding.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> But would not that be
usurping an authority that more properly
belongs to yourself?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> My dear friend, you know
but little of my authority at home.
People think, indeed, because they see
me come out in a morning thus, with
a pleasant face, and to make my friends
merry, that all's well within. But I
<a id='Page_298'></a>have cares that would break a heart of
stone. My wife has so encroached upon
every one of my privileges, that I'm
now no more than a mere lodger in
my own house.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> But a little spirit exerted
on your side might perhaps restore
your authority.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> No, though I had the
spirit of a lion. I do rouse sometimes.
But what then? always haggling and
haggling. A man is tired of getting
the better, before his wife is tired of
losing the victory.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> It's a melancholy consideration
indeed, that our chief comforts
often produce our greatest anxieties,
and that an increase of our possessions
is but an inlet to new disquietudes.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Ah, my dear friend, these
were the very words of poor Dick
Doleful to me not a week before he
made away with himself. Indeed, Mr.
Honeywood, I never see you but you
put me in mind of poor Dick. Ah,
there was merit neglected for you!
and so true a friend; we loved each
other for thirty years, and yet he never
asked me to lend him a single farthing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Pray what could induce
him to commit so rash an action at last?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> I don't know, some people
were malicious enough to say it was
keeping company with me; because
we used to meet now and then, and
open our hearts to each other. To be
sure I loved to hear him talk, and he
loved to hear me talk; poor dear Dick!
He used to say, that Croaker rhymed
to joker; and so we used to laugh—Poor
Dick!</p>

miserable life, where we do nothing
but eat and grow hungry, dress and
undress, get up and lie down; while
<a id='Page_299'></a>reason, that should watch like a nurse
by our side, falls as fast asleep as we
do.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> To say truth, if we compare
that part of life which is to come,
by that which we have passed, the
prospect is hideous.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Life at the greatest and
best is but a froward child, that must
be humoured and coaxed a little till it
falls asleep, and then all the care is
over.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Very true, sir; nothing
can exceed the vanity of our existence,
but the folly of our pursuits. We
wept when we came into the world,
and every day tells us why.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Ah, my dear friend, it is
a perfect satisfaction to be miserable
with you. My son Leontine shan't
lose the benefit of such fine conversation.
I'll just step home for him. I
am willing to show him so much
seriousness in one scarce older than
himself—And what if I bring my last
letter to the Gazetteer on the increase
and progress of earthquakes? It will
amuse us, I promise you. I there
prove how the late earthquake is
coming round to pay us another visit
from London to Lisbon, from Lisbon
to the Canary Islands, from the Canary
Islands to Palmyra, from Palmyra to
Constantinople, and so from Constantinople
back to London again.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Poor Croaker! His situation

scarce recover my spirits these three
days. Sure, to live upon such terms

friends in distress; the wish but not

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> You're always in such
spirits.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> We have just come,
my dear Honeywood, from the auction.
There was the old deaf dowager, as
usual, bidding like a fury against herself.
And then so curious in antiques!
herself the most genuine piece of antiquity
in the whole collection.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Excuse me, ladies, if some
uneasiness from friendship makes me
unfit to share in this good humour:
I know you'll pardon me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> I vow, he seems as
melancholy as if he had taken a dose
of my husband this morning. Well,
if Richland here can pardon you, I
must.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> You would seem to insinuate,
madam, that I have particular
reasons for being disposed to refuse it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Whatever I insinuate,
my dear, don't be so ready to wish
an explanation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I own I should be sorry
Mr. Honeywood's long friendship and
mine should be misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> There's no answering for
others, madam; but I hope you'll
never find me presuming to offer more
than the most delicate friendship may
readily allow.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> And, I shall be prouder
of such a tribute from you, than
the most passionate professions from
others.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> My own sentiments,
madam: friendship is a disinterested
commerce between equals; love, an
<a id='Page_301'></a>abject intercourse between tyrants and
slaves.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> And, without a compliment,
I know none more disinterested
or more capable of friendship than
Mr. Honeywood.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> And indeed I know
nobody that has more friends, at least
among the ladies. Miss Fruzz, Miss
Odbody, and Miss Winterbottom,
praise him in all companies. As for
Miss Biddy Bundle, she's his professed
admirer.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Indeed! an admirer!
I did not know, sir, you were such
a favourite there. But is she seriously
so handsome? Is she the mighty
thing talked of?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> The town, madam, seldom
begins to praise a lady's beauty, till
she's beginning to lose it.</p>

<p class='c016'>[<i>Smiling.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> But she's resolved
never to lose it, it seems; for as her
natural face decays, her skill improves
in making the artificial one. Well,
nothing diverts me more than one of
those fine old dressy things, who
thinks to conceal her age by everywhere
exposing her person; sticking
herself up in the front of a side-box;
trailing through a minuet at
Almack's; and then, in the public
gardens, looking for all the world like
one of the painted ruins of the place.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Every age has its admirers,
ladies. While you, perhaps,
are trading among the warmer climates
of youth, there ought to be some to
carry on a useful commerce in the
frozen latitudes beyond fifty.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> But then the mortifications
they must suffer before they can
be fitted out for traffic! I have seen
one of them fret a whole morning at
her hair-dresser, when all the fault
was her face.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_302'></a><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> And yet I'll engage, has
carried that face at last to a very good
market. This good-natured town,
madam, has husbands, like spectacles,
to fit every age, from fifteen to four-score.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Well, you're a dear
good-natured creature. But you know
you're engaged with us this morning
upon a strolling party. I want to
show Olivia the town and the things;
I believe I shall have business for you
for the whole day.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I am sorry, madam, I have
an appointment with Mr. Croaker,
which it is impossible to put off.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> What! with my
husband? Then I'm resolved to take
no refusal. Nay, I protest you must.
You know I never laugh so much as
with you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Why, if I must, I must,
I'll swear, you have put me into such
spirits. Well, do you find jest, and
I'll find laugh, I promise you. We'll
wait for the chariot in the next room.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Leontine</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Olivia</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> There they go, thoughtless
and happy. My dearest Olivia, what
would I give to see you capable of
sharing in their amusements, and as
cheerful as they are!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> How, my Leontine, how
can I be cheerful, when I have so many
terrors to oppress me? The fear of
being detected by this family, and the
apprehensions of a censuring world,
when I must be detected——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> The world! my love, what
can it say? At worst, it can only say
that, being compelled by a mercenary
guardian to embrace a life you disliked,
you formed a resolution of flying with
the man of your choice; that you confided
<a id='Page_303'></a>in his honour, and took refuge in
my father's house; the only one where
yours could remain without censure.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id037'>

<p>"<span class='sc'>Croaker.</span>—<i>Well, and you have both of<br />you a mutual choice.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 279.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> But consider, Leontine,
your disobedience and my indiscretion:
your being sent to France to
bring home a sister; and, instead of a
sister, bringing home——</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_304'></a><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> One dearer than a thousand
sisters; one that I am convinced
will be equally dear to the rest of the
family, when she comes to be known.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> And that I fear, will shortly
be.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Impossible till we ourselves
think proper to make the discovery.
My sister, you know, has been with
her aunt, at Lyons, since she was a
child; and you find every creature in
the family takes you for her.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> But mayn't she write?
mayn't her aunt write?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Her aunt scarce ever writes,
and all my sister's letters are directed
to me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> But won't your refusing
Miss Richland, for whom you know
the old gentleman intends you, create
a suspicion?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> There, there's my masterstroke.
I have resolved not to refuse
her; nay, an hour hence I have consented
to go with my father, to make
her an offer of my heart and fortune.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Your heart and fortune!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Don't be alarmed, my dearest.
Can Olivia think so meanly of
my honour, or my love, as to suppose
I could ever hope for happiness from
any but her? No, my Olivia, neither
the force, nor permit me to add, the
delicacy of my passion, leave any room
to suspect me. I only offer Miss
Richland a heart, I am convinced she
will refuse; as I am confident, that
without knowing it, her affections are
fixed upon Mr. Honeywood.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Mr. Honeywood! You'll
excuse my apprehensions; but when
your merits come to be put in the
balance—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> You view them with too
much partiality. However, by making
this offer, I show a seeming compliance
<a id='Page_305'></a>with my father's commands; and perhaps,
upon her refusal, I may have his
consent to choose for myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Well, I submit. And, yet
my Leontine, I own, I shall envy her,
even your pretended addresses. I consider
every look, every expression of
your esteem, as due only to me. This
is folly, perhaps: I allow it; but it is
natural to suppose, that merit which has
made an impression on one's own heart,
may be powerful over that of another.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Don't, my life's treasure,
don't let us make imaginary evils, when
you know we have so many real ones
to encounter. At worst, you know, if
Miss Richland should consent, or my
father refuse his pardon, it can but
end in a trip to Scotland; and——</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Croaker</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Where have you been,
boy? I have been seeking you. My
friend Honeywood here has been saying
such comfortable things. Ah! he's
an example indeed. Where is he? I
left him here.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Sir, I believe you may see
him, and hear him too, in the next
room: he's preparing to go out with
the ladies.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Good gracious, can I believe
my eyes or my ears? I'm struck
dumb with his vivacity, and stunned
with the loudness of his laugh. Was
there ever such a transformation? (<i>A
laugh behind the scenes</i>; <span class='sc'>Croaker</span>
<i>mimics it</i>.) Ha! ha! ha! there it
goes: a plague take their balderdash;
yet I could expect nothing less, when
my precious wife was of the party.
On my conscience, I believe she could
spread a horse-laugh through the pews
of a tabernacle.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Since you find so many objections
to a wife, sir, how can you be
<a id='Page_306'></a>so earnest in recommending one to
me?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> I have told you, and tell
you again, boy, that Miss Richland's
fortune must not go out of the family;
one may find comfort in the money,
whatever one does in the wife.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> But, sir, though in obedience
to your desire, I am ready to
marry her; it may be possible, she has
no inclination to me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> I'll tell you once for all
how it stands. A good part of Miss
Richland's large fortune consists in a
claim upon government, which my
good friend, Mr. Lofty, assures me
the treasury will allow. One half of
this she is to forfeit, by her father's
will, in case she refuses to marry you.
So if she rejects you, we seize half her
fortune; if she accepts you, we seize
the whole, and a fine girl into the
bargain.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> But, sir, if you will but
listen to reason—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Come, then produce your
reasons. I tell you I'm fixed, determined,
so now produce your reasons.
When I'm determined I always listen
to reason, because it can then do no
harm.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> You have alleged that a
mutual choice was the first requisite
in matrimonial happiness—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Well, and you have both
of you a mutual choice. She has her
choice—to marry you, or lose half her
fortune; and you have your choice—to
marry her, or pack out of doors
without any fortune at all.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> An only son, sir, might
expect more indulgence.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> An only father, sir, might
expect more obedience; besides, has
not your sister here, that never disobliged
me in her life, as good a right
as you? He's a sad dog, Livy my
dear, and would take all from you.
But he shan't, I tell you he shan't, for
you shall have your share.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Dear sir, I wish you'd be
convinced that I can never be happy
in any addition to my fortune, which
is taken from his.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Well, well, it's a good
child; so say no more, but come with
me, and we shall see something that
will give us a great deal of pleasure, I
promise you; old Ruggins, the currycomb
maker, lying in state: I'm told
he makes a very handsome corpse, and
becomes his coffin prodigiously. He
was an intimate friend of mine, and
these are friendly things we ought to
do for each other.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Richland</span>, <span class='sc'>Garnet</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Olivia not his sister?
Olivia not Leontine's sister? You amaze me!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> No more his sister than I
am; I had it all from his own servant;
I can get anything from that
quarter.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_308'></a><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> But how? Tell me
again, Garnet.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Why madam, as I told
you before, instead of going to Lyons
to bring home his sister, who has been
there with her aunt these ten years he
never went further than Paris; there
he saw and fell in love with this
young lady: by the bye, of a prodigious
family.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> And brought her home
to my guardian, as his daughter.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Yes, and daughter she will
be. If he don't consent to their marriage,
they talk of trying what a Scotch
parson can do.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Well, I own they have
deceived me—And so demurely as
Olivia carried it too!—Would you believe
it, Garnet, I told her all my
secrets; and yet the sly cheat concealed
all this from me?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> And, upon my word, madam,
I don't much blame her; she
was loth to trust one with her secrets,
that was so very bad at keeping her
own.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> But, to add to their
deceit, the young gentleman, it seems,
pretends to make me serious proposals.
My guardian and he are to be here
presently, to open the affair in form.
You know I am to lose half my fortune
if I refuse him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Yet what can you do? for
being, as you are, in love with Mr.
Honeywood, madam—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> How, idiot! what do
you mean? In love with Mr. Honeywood!
Is this to provoke me?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> That is, madam, in friendship
with him; I meant nothing more
than friendship, as I hope to be married;
nothing more.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Well, no more of this.
As to my guardian and his son, they
<a id='Page_309'></a>shall find me prepared to receive them;
I'm resolved to accept their proposal
with seeming pleasure, to mortify them
by compliance, and so throw the refusal
at last upon them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Delicious! and that will
secure your whole fortune to yourself.
Well, who could have thought so innocent
a face could cover so much cuteness?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Why, girl, I only oppose
my prudence to their cunning, and
practise a lesson they have taught me
against themselves.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Then you're likely not
long to want employment; for here
they come, and in close conference.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Croaker</span>, <span class='sc'>Leontine</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Excuse me, sir, if I seem to
hesitate upon the point of putting to
the lady so important a question.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Lord, good sir! moderate
your fears; you're so plaguy shy, that
one would think you had changed
sexes. I tell you, we must have the
half or the whole. Come, let me see
with what spirit you begin. Well,
why don't you? Eh? What? Well
then—I must, it seems. Miss Richland,
my dear, I believe you guess at
our business; an affair which my son
here comes to open, that nearly concerns
your happiness.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Sir, I should be ungrateful
not to be pleased with anything
that comes recommended by
you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> How, boy, could you desire
a finer opportunity? Why don't
you begin, I say?</p>

<p class='c016'>[<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Leont.</span></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> 'Tis true, madam, my father,
madam, has some intentions—hem—of
explaining an affair—which—himself—can
best explain, madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Yes, my dear; it comes
<a id='Page_310'></a>entirely from my son; it's all a request
of his own, madam. And I will permit
him to make the best of it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> The whole affair is only this,
madam; my father has a proposal to
make, which he insists none but himself
shall deliver.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> My mind misgives me,
the fellow will never be brought on.
(<i>Aside.</i>) In short, madam, you see
before you one that loves you; one
whose whole happiness is all in you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I never had any doubts
of your regard, sir; and I hope you
can have none of my duty.</p>

</div>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> That's not the thing, my
little sweeting, my love. No, no,
another-guess lover than I, there he
stands, madam; his very looks declare
the force of his passion—Call up a
look, you dog—But then, had you
seen him, as I have, weeping, speaking
soliloquies and blank verse, sometimes
melancholy, and sometimes absent—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I fear, sir, he's absent
now; or such a declaration would have
come most properly from himself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Himself, madam! He
would die before he could make such
a confession; and if he had not a
channel for his passion through me, it
would ere now have drowned his understanding.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I must grant, sir, there
are attractions in modest diffidence,
above the force of words. A silent
<a id='Page_311'></a>address is the genuine eloquence of
sincerity.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Madam, he has forgot to
speak any other language; silence is
become his mother-tongue.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> And it must be confessed,
sir, it speaks very powerful in
his favour. And yet, I shall be thought
too forward in making such a confession;
shan't I, Mr. Leontine?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Confusion! my reserve will
undo me. But, if modesty attracts
her, impudence may disgust her. I'll
try. (<i>Aside.</i>) Don't imagine from my
silence, madam, that I want a due sense
of the honour and happiness intended
me. My father, madam, tells me,
your humble servant is not totally indifferent
to you. He admires you; I
adore you; and when we come together,
upon my soul I believe we
shall be the happiest couple in all St.
James's.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> If I could flatter myself,
you thought as you speak, sir—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Doubt my sincerity, madam?
By your dear self I swear. Ask the
brave if they desire glory, ask cowards
if they covet safety—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Well, well, no more questions
about it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Ask the sick if they long for
health, ask misers if they love money,
ask—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Ask a fool if he can talk
nonsense! What's come over the
boy? What signifies asking, when
there's not a soul to give you an
answer? If you would ask to the
purpose, ask this lady's consent to
make you happy.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Why indeed, sir, his
uncommon ardour almost compels me,
forces me, to comply, And yet I am
afraid he'll despise a conquest gained
<a id='Page_312'></a>with too much ease; won't you Mr.
Leontine?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Confusion! (<i>Aside.</i>) O, by
no means, madam, by no means. And
yet, madam, you talked of force.
There is nothing I would avoid so
much as compulsion in a thing of this
kind. No, madam; I will still be
generous, and leave you at liberty to
refuse.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> But I tell you, sir, the
lady is not at liberty. It's a match.
You see she says nothing. Silence
gives consent.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> But, sir, she talked of force.
Consider, sir, the cruelty of constraining
her inclinations.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> But I say there's no
cruelty. Don't you know, blockhead,
that girls have always a round-about
way of saying Yes before company?
So get you both gone together into the
next room, and hang him that interrupts
the tender explanation. Get you
gone, I say; I'll not hear a word.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> But, sir, I must beg leave
to insist—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Get off, you puppy, or
I'll beg leave to insist upon knocking
you down. Stupid whelp! But I
don't wonder; the boy takes entirely
after his mother.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Mr. Croaker, I

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> I'll hold you a guinea of
that, my dear.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> A letter; and, as I
knew the hand, I ventured to open it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> And how can you expect
your breaking open my letters should
give me pleasure?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Pooh, it's from your

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> What a Frenchified cover
is here! That sister of mine has some
good qualities, but I could never teach
her to fold a letter.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Fold a fiddlestick!
Read what it contains.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_314'></a><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> (<i>reading.</i>) "Dear Nick,—An
English gentleman, of large fortune,
has for some time made private,
though honourable, proposals to your
daughter Olivia. They love each other
tenderly, and I find she has consented,
without letting any of the family know,
to crown his addresses. As such good
offers don't come every day, your own
good sense, his large fortune, and
family considerations, will induce you
to forgive her.—Yours ever, Rachel
Croaker." My daughter Olivia privately
contracted to a man of large
fortune! This is good news indeed.
My heart never foretold me of this. And
yet, how slily the little baggage has
carried it since she came home! Not
a word on't to the old ones, for the
world! Yet I thought I saw something
she wanted to conceal.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Well, if they have
concealed their amour, they shan't
conceal their wedding; that shall be
public, I'm resolved.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> I tell thee, woman, the
wedding is the most foolish part of the
ceremony. I can never get this woman
to think of the more serious part of
the nuptial engagement.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> What, would you
have me think of their funeral? But
come, tell me, my dear, don't you owe
more to me than you care to confess?
Would you have ever been known to
Mr. Lofty, who has undertaken Miss
Richland's claim at the Treasury, but
for me? Who was it first made him
an acquaintance at Lady Shabbaroon's
rout? Who got him to promise us
his interest? Is not he a back-stairs
favourite, one that can do what he
pleases with those that do what they
please? Isn't he an acquaintance that
all your groaning and lamentations
could never have got us?</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_315'></a><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> He is a man of importance,
I grant you; and yet, what
amazes me is, that while he is giving
away places to all the world, he can't
get one for himself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> That perhaps may
be owing to his nicety. Great men
are not easily satisfied.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>French Servant</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> An expresse from Monsieur
Lofty. He vil be vait upon your
honours instamment. He be only
giving four five instruction, read two
tree memorial, call upon von ambassadeur.
He vil be vid you in one tree
minutes.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> You see now, my
dear, what an extensive department.
Well, friend, let your master know,
that we are extremely honoured by this
honour. Was there any thing ever in
a higher style of breeding? All messages
among the great are now done
by express.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> To be sure, no man does
little things with more solemnity, or
claims more respect, than he. But
he's in the right on't. In our bad
world, respect is given where respect
is claimed.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Never mind the
world, my dear; you were never in a
pleasanter place in your life. Let us
now think of receiving him with proper
respect: (<i>a loud rapping at the door</i>)
and there he is, by the thundering
rap.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Ay, verily, there he is;
as close upon the heels of his own
express, as an endorsement upon the
back of a bill. Well, I'll leave you to
receive him, whilst I go to chide my
little Olivia for intending to steal a
marriage without mine or her aunt's
consent. I must seem to be angry, or
<a id='Page_316'></a>she too may begin to despise my
authority.</p>

Dam'me, I'll be packhorse to none of

to his grace be ready, let them
be sent off; they're of importance.
Madam, I ask a thousand pardons.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Sir, this honour—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> And, Dubardieu, if the person
calls about the commission, let
him know that it is made out. As for
Lord Cumbercourt's stale request; it
can keep cold: you understand me.
Madam, I ask ten thousand pardons.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Sir, this honour—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> And, Dubardieu, if the man
comes from the Cornish borough, you
must do him; you must do him, I say.
Madam, I ask ten thousand pardons.
And if the Russian ambassador calls;
but he will scarce call to-day, I believe.
And now, madam, I have just got time
to express my happiness in having the
honour of being permitted to profess
myself your most obedient humble
servant.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Sir, the happiness
and honour are all mine: and yet I'm
only robbing the public while I detain
you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Sink the public, madam,
when the fair are to be attended. Ah,
could all my hours be so charmingly
devoted! Sincerely, don't you pity us
poor creatures in affairs? Thus it is
eternally; solicited for places here,
teazed for pensions there, and courted
everywhere. I know you pity me.
Yes, I see you do.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Excuse me, sir;
<a id='Page_317'></a>"Toils of empires pleasures are," as
Waller says.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Waller, Waller; is he of
the house?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> The modern poet
of that name, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Oh, a modern! We men of
business despise the moderns; and as
for the ancients, we have no time to
read them. Poetry is a pretty thing
enough for our wives and daughters;
but not for us. Why now, here I
stand that know nothing of books;
I say, madam, I know nothing of
books; and yet, I believe, upon a
land carriage fishery, a stamp act, or
a jaghire, I can talk my two hours
without feeling the want of them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> The world is no
stranger to Mr. Lofty's eminence in
every capacity.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> I vow to gad, madam, you
make me blush. I'm nothing, nothing,
nothing, in the world; a mere obscure
gentleman. To be sure, indeed, one
or two of the present ministers are
pleased to represent me as a formidable
man. I know they are pleased to
bespatter me at all their little dirty
levees. Yet, upon my soul, I wonder
what they see in me to treat me so.
Measures, not men, have always been
my mark; and I vow, by all that's
honourable, my resentment has never
done the men, as mere men, any manner
of harm—that is, as mere men.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> What importance,
and yet what modesty!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Oh, if you talk of modesty,
madam; there, I own, I'm accessible
to praise: modesty is my foible: it
was so, the Duke of Brentford used to
say of me. I love Jack Lofty, he used
to say: no man has a finer knowledge
of things; quite a man of information;
and when he speaks upon his
<a id='Page_318'></a>legs, by the Lord he's prodigious; he
scouts them: and yet all men have
their faults; too much modesty is his,
says his grace.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> And yet, I dare
say, you don't want assurance when
you come to solicit for your friends.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> O, there indeed I'm in
bronze. Apropos, I have just been
mentioning Miss Richland's case to a
certain personage; we must name no
names. When I ask, I am not to be
put off, madam. No, no, I take my
friend by the button. "A fine girl,
sir; great justice in her case. A friend
of mine. Borough interest. Business
must be done, Mr. Secretary. I say,
Mr. Secretary, her business must be
done, sir." That's my way, madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Bless me! you said
all this to the secretary of state, did
you?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> I did not say the secretary,
did I? Well, curse it, since you have
found me out I will not deny it. It
was to the secretary.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> This was going to
the fountain head at once; not applying
to the understrappers, as Mr.
Honeywood would have had us.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Honeywood! he-he! He
was, indeed, a fine solicitor. I suppose
you have heard what has just
happened to him?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Poor dear man!
No accident, I hope.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Undone, madam, that's all.
His creditors have taken him into
custody. A prisoner in his own house.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> A prisoner in his
own house! How! At this very time?
I'm quite unhappy for him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Why, so am I. The man,
to be sure, was immensely good-natured;
but then, I could never find
that he had anything in him.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_319'></a><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> His manner, to be
sure, was excessive harmless; some,
indeed, thought it a little dull. For
my part I always concealed my opinion.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> It can't be concealed, madam:
the man was dull, dull as the
last new comedy! A poor impracticable
creature! I tried once or twice
to know if he was fit for business, but
he had scarce talents to be groom-porter
to an orange barrow.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> How differently
does Miss Richland think of him! for,
I believe, with all his faults, she loves
him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Loves him! Does she? You
should cure her of that, by all means.
Let me see: what if she were sent to
him this instant, in his present doleful
situation? My life for it, that works
her cure. Distress is a perfect antidote
to love. Suppose we join her in the
next room? Miss Richland is a fine
girl, has a fine fortune, and must not
be thrown away. Upon my honour,
madam, I have a regard for Miss
Richland; and, rather than she should
be thrown away, I should think it no
indignity to marry her myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> And yet, trust me, Olivia,
I had every reason to expect Miss
Richland's refusal, as I did everything
in my power to deserve it. Her indelicacy
surprises me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Sure, Leontine, there's
nothing so indelicate in being sensible
of your merit. If so, I fear I shall be
the most guilty thing alive.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> But you mistake, my dear.
The same attention I used to advance
my merit with you, I practised to lessen
it with her. What more could I do?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Let us now rather consider
what's to be done. We have both
<a id='Page_320'></a>dissembled too long. I have always
been ashamed, I am now quite weary,
of it. Sure, I could never have undergone
so much for any other but you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> And you shall find my
gratitude equal to your kindest compliance.
Though our friends should
totally forsake us, Olivia, we can draw
upon content for the deficiencies of
fortune.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Then why should we defer
our scheme of humble happiness, when
it is now in our power? I may be
the favourite of your father, it is true;
but can it ever be thought, that his
present kindness to a supposed child,
will continue to a known deceiver?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> I have many reasons to
believe it will. As his attachments
are but few, they are lasting. His
own marriage was a private one, as
ours may be. Besides, I have sounded
him already at a distance, and find all
his answers exactly to our wish. Nay
by an expression or two that dropp'd
from him, I am induced to think he
knows of this affair.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Indeed! But that would
be a happiness too great to be expected.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> However it be, I'm certain
you have power over him; and am
persuaded, if you informed him of
our situation, that he would be disposed
to pardon it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> You had equal expectations,
Leontine, from your last scheme with
Miss Richland, which you find has
succeeded most wretchedly.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> And that's the best reason
for trying another.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> If it must be so, I submit.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> As we could wish, he comes
this way. Now, my dearest Olivia, be
resolute. I'll just retire within hearing,
to come in at a proper time, either
<a id='Page_321'></a>to share your danger, or confirm your
victory.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Yes, I must forgive her;
and yet not too easily, neither. It will
be proper to keep up the decorums
of resentment a little, if it be only
to impress her with an idea of my
authority.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> How I tremble to approach
him!—Might I presume, sir—If I
interrupt you—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> No, child; where I have
an affection, it is not a little thing
can interrupt me. Affection gets over
little things.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Sir, you're too kind. I'm
sensible how ill I deserve this partiality.
Yet Heaven knows there is nothing I
would not do to gain it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> And you have but too
well succeeded, you little hussy, you.
With those endearing ways of yours,
on my conscience, I could be brought
to forgive any thing, unless it were a
very great offence indeed.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> But mine is such an offence—When
you know my guilt—Yes,
you shall know it, though I feel the
greatest pain in the confession.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Why then, if it be so
very great a pain, you may spare yourself
the trouble, for I know every
syllable of the matter before you
begin.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Indeed! Then I'm undone.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Ay, miss, you wanted to
steal a match, without letting me
know it, did you? But I'm not
worth being consulted, I suppose, when
there's to be a marriage in my own
family. No, I'm to have no hand in
the disposal of my own children. No,
I'm nobody. I'm to be a mere article
of family lumber; a piece of crack'd
china to be stuck up in a corner.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_322'></a><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Dear sir, nothing but the
dread of your authority could induce
us to conceal it from you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> No, no, my consequence
is no more; I'm as little minded as a
dead Russian in winter, just stuck up
with a pipe in his mouth till there
comes a thaw—It goes to my heart to
vex her.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> I was prepared, sir, for
your anger, and despaired of pardon,
even while I presumed to ask it. But
your severity shall never abate my
affection, as my punishment is but
justice.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> And yet you should not
despair neither, Livy. We ought to
hope all for the best.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> And do you permit me to
hope, sir? Can I ever expect to be
forgiven? But hope has too long
deceived me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Why then, child, it shan't
deceive you now, for I forgive you this
very moment; I forgive you all; and
now you are indeed my daughter.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> O transport! This kindness
overpowers me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> I was always against
severity to our children. We have
been young and giddy ourselves, and
we can't expect boys and girls to be
old before their time.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> What generosity! But can
you forget the many falsehoods, the
dissimulation——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> You did indeed dissemble,
you urchin you; but where's the
girl that won't dissemble for a husband?
My wife and I had never been married,
if we had not dissembled a little
beforehand.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> It shall be my future care
never to put such generosity to a
second trial. And as for the partner
of my offence and folly, from his native
<a id='Page_323'></a>honour, and the just sense he has of
his duty, I can answer for him
that——</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Leontine</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Permit him thus to answer
for himself. (<i>Kneeling.</i>) Thus, sir,
let me speak my gratitude for this unmerited
forgiveness. Yes, sir, this
even exceeds all your former tenderness:
I now can boast the most indulgent
of fathers. The life he gave,
compared to this, was but a trifling
blessing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> And, good sir, who sent
for you, with that fine tragedy face,
and flourishing manner? I don't
know what we have to do with your
gratitude upon this occasion.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> How, sir, is it possible to be
silent when so much obliged? Would
you refuse me the pleasure of being
grateful? Of adding my thanks to
my Olivia's? Of sharing in the transports
that you have thus occasioned?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Lord, sir, we can be
happy enough, without your coming in
to make up the party. I don't know
what's the matter with the boy all this
day; he has got into such a rhodomontade
manner all the morning!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> But, sir, I that have so
large a part in the benefit, is it not
my duty to show my joy? Is the
being admitted to your favour so
slight an obligation? Is the happiness
of marrying my Olivia so small a
blessing?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Marrying Olivia! marrying
Olivia! marrying his own sister!
Sure the boy is out of his senses! His
own sister!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> My sister!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Sister! How have I been

<p class='c016'><i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Some cursed mistake in all
this, I find.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_324'></a><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> What does the booby
mean, or has he any meaning? Eh,

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Mean, sir—why, sir—only
when my sister is to be married, that I
have the pleasure of marrying her, sir;
that is, of giving her away, sir—I have
made a point of it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> O, is that all? Give her
away. You have made a point of it.
Then you had as good make a point of
first giving away yourself, as I'm
going to prepare the writings between
you and Miss Richland this very
minute. What a fuss is here about
nothing! Why, what's the matter
now? I thought I had made you at

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Scene.—Young Honeywood's</span> <i>House</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff</span>, <span class='sc'>Honeywood</span>, <span class='sc'>Follower</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Look-ye, sir, I have arrested
as good men as you in my time;
no disparagement of you neither. Men
that would go forty guineas on a game
of cribbage. I challenge the town to
show a man in more genteeler practice
than myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Without all question,
Mr. ——. I forget your name, sir?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> How can you forget what
you never knew? he, he, he!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> May I beg leave to ask
your name?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Yes, you may.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Then, pray, sir, what is
your name, sir?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> That I didn't promise to
tell you; he, he, he! A joke breaks
no bones, as we say among us that
practise the law.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> You may have reason for
keeping it a secret perhaps.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> The law does nothing
without reason. I'm ashamed to tell
my name to no man, sir. If you can
show cause, as why, upon a special
capus, that I should prove my name—But,
come, Timothy Twitch is my
name. And, now you know my name,
what have you to say to that?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Nothing in the world,
good Mr. Twitch, but that I have a
favour to ask, that's all.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Ay, favours are more
easily asked than granted, as we say
among us that practise the law. I
have taken an oath against granting
favours. Would you have me perjure
myself?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> But my request will come
recommended in so strong a manner,
as, I believe, you'll have no scruple.
(<i>Pulling out his purse.</i>) The thing is
only this: I believe I shall be able to
discharge this trifle in two or three
days at farthest; but as I would not
have the affair known for the world, I
have thought of keeping you, and your
good friend here, about me till the
debt is discharged; for which I shall
be properly grateful.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Oh! that's another maxum,
and altogether within my oath. For
certain, if an honest man is to get
anything by a thing, there's no reason
why all things should not be done in
civility.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Doubtless, all trades must
live, Mr. Twitch, and yours is a necessary
one. (<i>Gives him money.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Oh! your honour; I hope
your honour takes nothing amiss as I
does, as I does nothing but my duty
<a id='Page_327'></a>in so doing. I'm sure no man can say
I ever give a gentleman, that was a
gentleman, ill-usage. If I saw that a
gentleman was a gentleman, I have
taken money not to see him for ten
weeks together.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Tenderness is a virtue,
Mr. Twitch.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Ay, sir, it's a perfect treasure.
I love to see a gentleman with
a tender heart. I don't know, but I
think I have a tender heart myself. If
all that I have lost by my heart was
put together, it would make a—but
no matter for that.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Don't account it lost, Mr.
Twitch. The ingratitude of the world
can never deprive us of the conscious
happiness of having acted with humanity
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Humanity, sir, is a jewel.
It's better than gold. I love humanity.
People may say that we, in our way,
have no humanity; but I'll show you
my humanity this moment. There's
my follower here, little Flanigan, with
a wife and four children, a guinea or
two would be more to him, than twice
as much to another. Now, as I can't
show him any humanity myself, I must
beg you'll do it for me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I assure you, Mr. Twitch,
yours is a most powerful recommendation.
(<i>Giving money to the</i> <span class='sc'>Follower</span>.)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Sir, you're a gentleman.
I see you know what to do with your
money. But, to business: we are to
be with you here as your friends, I
suppose. But set in case company
comes.—Little Flanigan here, to be
sure, has a good face; a very good
face; but then, he is a little seedy, as
we say among us that practise the law.
Not well in clothes. Smoke the pocket-holes.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_328'></a><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Well, that should be remedied
without delay.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Servant</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> Sir, Miss Richland is
below.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> How unlucky! Detain
her a moment. We must improve,
my good friend, little Mr. Flanigan's
appearance first. Here, let Mr. Flanigan
have a suit of my clothes—quick—the
brown and silver—Do you hear?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> That your honour gave
away to the begging gentleman that
makes verses, because it was as good
as new.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> The white and gold then.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> That, your honour, I
made bold to sell because it was good
for nothing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Well, the first that comes
to hand then. The blue and gold. I
believe Mr. Flanigan will look best
in blue.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>[<i>Exit</i> <span class='sc'>Flanigan</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Rabbit me, but little Flanigan
will look well in anything. Ah,
if your honour knew that bit of flesh
as well as I do, you'd be perfectly in
love with him. There's not a prettier
scout in the four counties after a shy-cock
than he. Scents like a hound;
sticks like a weasel. He was master
of the ceremonies to the black queen
of Morocco when I took him to follow
me. [<i>Re-enter</i> <span class='sc'>Flanigan</span>.] Heh, ecod,
I think he looks so well, that I don't
care if I have a suit from the same
place for myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Well, well, I hear the
lady coming. Dear Mr. Twitch, I beg
you'll give your friend directions not
to speak. As for yourself, I know
you will say nothing without being
directed.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Never you fear me, I'll
show the lady that I have something
<a id='Page_329'></a>to say for myself as well as another.
One man has one way of talking, and
another man has another, that's all the
difference between them.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Richland</span> <i>and her</i> <span class='sc'>Maid</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> You'll be surprised, sir,
with this visit. But you know I'm
yet to thank you for choosing my little
library.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Thanks, madam, are unnecessary,
as it was I that was obliged
by your commands. Chairs here.
Two of my very good friends, Mr.
Twitch, and Mr. Flanigan. Pray,
gentlemen, sit without ceremony.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Who can these odd-looking
men be? I fear it is as I was
informed. It must be so.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff</span> (<i>after a pause</i>). Pretty
weather, very pretty weather, for the
time of the year, madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Follower.</span> Very good circuit weather
in the country.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> You officers are generally
favourites among the ladies. My
friends, madam, have been upon very
disagreeable duty, I assure you. The
fair should, in some measure, recompense
the toils of the brave.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Our officers do indeed
deserve every favour. The gentlemen
are in the marine service, I presume, sir?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Why, madam, they do—occasionally
serve in the Fleet, madam.
A dangerous service.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I'm told so. And I
own, it has often surprised me, that,
while we have had so many instances
of bravery there, we have had so few
of wit at home to praise it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I grant, madam, that our
poets have not written as our soldiers
have fought; but, they have done all
they could, and Hawke or Amherst
could do no more.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_330'></a><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I'm quite displeased
when I see a fine subject spoiled by a
dull writer.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> We should not be so
severe against dull writers, madam.
It is ten to one, but the dullest writer
exceeds the most rigid French critic
who presumes to despise him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Follower.</span> Damn the French, the
parle vous, and all that belongs to
them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Sir!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Ha, ha, ha, honest Mr.
Flanigan. A true English officer,
madam; he's not contented with beating
the French, but he will scold them
too.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Yet, Mr. Honeywood,
this does not convince me but that
severity in criticism is necessary. It
was our first adopting the severity of
French taste, that has brought them
in turn to taste us.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Taste us! By the Lord,
madam, they devour us. Give Monseers
but a taste, and I'll be damn'd,
but they come in for a bellyful.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Very extraordinary this.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Follower.</span> But very true. What
makes the bread rising? the parle vous
that devour us. What makes the
mutton five pence a pound? the parle
vous that eat it up. What makes the
beer threepence halfpenny a pot—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Ah! the vulgar rogues,
all will be out. Right, gentlemen,
very right upon my word, and quite
to the purpose. They draw a parallel,
madam, between the mental taste, and
that of our senses. We are injured
as much by French severity in the one,
as by French rapacity in the other.
That's their meaning.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Though I don't see the
force of the parallel, yet, I'll own, that
we should sometimes pardon books, as
<a id='Page_331'></a>we do our friends, that have now and
then agreeable absurdities to recommend
them.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span>—"<i>Taste us! By the Lord,<br />madam, they devour us.</i>"—<i>p.</i> 292.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> That's all my eye. The
king only can pardon, as the law says;
for set in case——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I'm quite of your opinion,
sir. I see the whole drift of your
<a id='Page_332'></a>argument. Yes, certainly our presuming
to pardon any work, is arrogating
a power that belongs to another.
If all have power to condemn, what
writer can be free?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> By his habus corpus. His
habus corpus can set him free at any
time. For set in case—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I'm obliged to you, sir,
for the hint. If madam, as my friend
observes, our laws are so careful of a
gentleman's person, sure we ought to
be equally careful of his dearer part,
his fame.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Follower.</span> Ay, but if so be a man's
nabbed, you know—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Mr. Flanigan, if you spoke
for ever, you could not improve the
last observation. For my own part,
I think it conclusive.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> As for the matter of that,
mayhap——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Nay, sir, give me leave
in this instance to be positive. For
where is the necessity of censuring
works without genius, which must
shortly sink of themselves: what is
it, but aiming our unnecessary blow
against a victim already under the
hands of justice?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Justice! O, by the elevens,
if you talk about justice, I think I am
at home there; for, in a course of
law—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> My dear Mr. Twitch, I
discern what you'd be at perfectly,
and I believe the lady must be sensible
of the art with which it is introduced.
I suppose you perceive the meaning,
madam, of his course of law?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I protest, sir, I do not.
I perceive only that you answer one
gentleman before he has finished, and
the other before he has well begun.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Madam, you are a gentlewoman,
and I will make the matter
<a id='Page_333'></a>out. This here question is about
severity and justice, and pardon, and
the like of they. Now to explain the
thing—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> O! curse your explanations.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Servant</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> Mr. Leontine, sir, below,
desires to speak with you upon earnest
business.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> That's lucky (<i>aside.</i>) Dear
madam, you'll excuse me, and my good
friends here, for a few minutes. There
are books, madam, to amuse you.
Come, gentlemen, you know I make
no ceremony with such friends. After
you, sir. Excuse me. Well, if I must;
but I know your natural politeness.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Bailiff.</span> Before and behind, you
know.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Follower.</span> Ay, ay, before and behind,
before and behind.</p>

<p class='c016'>[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class='sc'>Honeywood</span>, <span class='sc'>Bailiff</span>, <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Follower</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> What can all this mean,
Garnet?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Mean, madam? why, what
should it mean, but what Mr. Lofty
sent you here to see? These people he
calls officers, are officers sure enough:
sheriff's officers; bailiffs, madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Ay, it is certainly so.
Well, though his perplexities are far
from giving me pleasure; yet I own
there's something very ridiculous in
them, and a just punishment for his
dissimulation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> And so they are. But I
wonder, madam, that the lawyer you
just employed to pay his debts and set
him free, has not done it by this time.
He ought at least to have been here
before now. But lawyers are always
more ready to get a man into troubles,
than out of them.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_334'></a><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Sir William</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> For Miss Richland to
undertake setting him free, I own, was
quite unexpected. It has totally unhinged
my schemes to reclaim him.
Yet, it gives me pleasure to find, that,
among a number of worthless friendships,
he has made one acquisition of
real value; for there must be some
softer passion on her side that prompts
this generosity. Ha! here before me:
I'll endeavour to sound her affections.
Madam, as I am the person that have
had some demands upon the gentleman
of this house, I hope you'll excuse me,
if, before I enlarged him, I wanted to
see yourself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> The precaution was
very unnecessary, sir. I suppose your
wants were only such as my agent had
power to satisfy.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Partly, madam. But, I
was also willing you should be fully
apprised of the character of the gentleman
you intended to serve.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> It must come, sir, with
a very ill grace from you. To censure
it, after what you have done, would
look like malice; and to speak favourably
of a character you have oppressed,
would be impeaching your own. And
sure, his tenderness, his humanity, his
universal friendship, may atone for
many faults.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> That friendship, madam,
which is exerted in too wide a sphere,
becomes totally useless. Our bounty,
like a drop of water, disappears when
diffused too widely. They, who pretend
most to this universal benevolence,
are either deceivers, or dupes—men
who desire to cover their private ill-nature
by a pretended regard for all;
or men who, reasoning themselves into
false feelings, are more earnest in pursuit
of splendid, than of useful virtues.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_335'></a><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I am surprised, sir, to
hear one who has probably been a
gainer by the folly of others, so severe
in his censure of it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Whatever I may have
gained by folly, madam, you see I am
willing to prevent your losing by it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Your cares for me, sir,
are unnecessary. I always suspect
those services which are denied where
they are wanted, and offered, perhaps,
in hopes of a refusal. No, sir, my
directions have been given, and I insist
upon their being complied with.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Thou amiable woman, I
can no longer contain the expressions
of my gratitude—my pleasure. You
see before you one who has been equally
careful of his interest: one, who has
for some time been a concealed spectator
of his follies, and only punished,
in hopes to reclaim them—His uncle.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Sir William Honeywood!
You amaze me! How shall I
conceal my confusion? I fear, sir,
you'll think I have been too forward
in my services. I confess I——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Don't make any apologies,
madam. I only find myself unable to
repay the obligation. And yet, I have
been trying my interest of late to serve
you. Having learnt, madam, that you
had some demands upon government,
I have, though unasked, been your
solicitor there.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Sir, I am infinitely obliged
to your intentions; but my
guardian has employed another gentleman,
who assures him of success.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Who, the important little
man that visits here? Trust me,
madam, he's quite contemptible among
men in power, and utterly unable to
serve you. Mr. Lofty's promises are
much better known to people of fashion
than his person, I assure you.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_336'></a><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> How have we been
deceived! As sure as can be, here he
comes.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Does he? Remember
I'm to continue unknown. My return
to England has not as yet been made
public. With what impudence he
enters!</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Lofty</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Let the chariot—let my
chariot drive off, I'll visit to his grace's
in a chair. Miss Richland here before
me! Punctual, as usual, to the calls
of humanity. I'm very sorry, madam,
things of this kind should happen,
especially to a man I have shown every
where, and carried amongst us as a
particular acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I find, sir, you have
the art of making the misfortunes of
others your own.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> My dear madam, what can
a private man like me do? One man
can't do everything; and then, I do
so much in this way every day. Let
me see, something considerable might
be done for him by subscription; it
could not fail if I carried the list. I'll
undertake to set down a brace of dukes,
two dozen lords, and half the lower
house, at my own peril.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> And after all, it is more
than probable, sir, he might reject the
offer, of such powerful patronage.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Then, madam, what can we
do? You know I never make promises.
In truth, I once or twice tried
to do something with him in the way
of business; but as I often told his
uncle, Sir William Honeywood, the
man was utterly impracticable.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> His uncle! Then that
gentleman, I suppose, is a particular
friend of yours?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Meaning me, sir?—Yes,
madam, as I often said, My dear Sir
<a id='Page_337'></a>William, you are sensible I would do
anything as far as my poor interest
goes, to serve your family; but what
can be done? there's no procuring
first-rate places for ninth-rate abilities.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I have heard of Sir
William Honeywood; he's abroad in
employment; he confided in your
judgment, I suppose.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Why, yes, madam; I believe
Sir William had some reason to confide
in my judgment; one little reason,
perhaps.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Pray, sir, what was
it?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Why, madam—but let it go
no further—it was I procured him his
place.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Did you, sir?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Either you or I, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> This, Mr. Lofty, was
very kind, indeed.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> I did love him, to be sure;
he had some amusing qualities; no
man was fitter to be toastmaster to a
club, or had a better head.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> A better head?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Ay, at a bottle. To be sure
he was as dull as a choice spirit; but
hang it, he was grateful, very grateful;
and gratitude hides a multitude of
faults.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> He might have reason,
perhaps. His place is pretty considerable,
I'm told.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> A trifle, a mere trifle, among
us men of business. The truth is, he
wanted dignity to fill up a greater.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Dignity of person, do
you mean sir? I'm told he's much
about my size and figure, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Ay, tall enough for a marching
regiment; but then he wanted a
something—a consequence of form—a
kind of a—I believe the lady perceives
my meaning.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_338'></a><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> O perfectly; you courtiers
can do any thing, I see.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> My dear madam, all this is
but a mere exchange; we do greater
things for one another every day. Why
as thus, now; let me suppose you the
first lord of the treasury; you have an
employment in you that I want; I
have a place in me that you want; do
me here, do you there: interest on both
sides, few words, flat, done and done,
and it's over.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> A thought strikes me
(<i>aside</i>). Now you mention Sir William
Honeywood, madam, and as he seems,
sir, an acquaintance of yours, you'll be
glad to hear he's arrived from Italy; I
had it from a friend who knows him
as well as he does me, and you may
depend on my information.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> The devil he is! If I had
known that we should not have been
quite so well acquainted (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> He is certainly returned;
and as this gentleman is a friend of
yours, he can be of signal service to us,
by introducing me to him; there are
some papers relative to your affairs,
that require dispatch and his inspection.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> This gentleman, Mr.
Lofty, is a person employed in my
affairs: I know you'll serve us.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_339'></a><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> My dear madam, I live but
to serve you. Sir William shall even
wait upon him, if you think proper to
command it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> That would be quite unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Well, we must introduce you
then. Call upon me—let me see—ay,
in two days.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Now, or the opportunity
will be lost for ever.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Well, if it must be now, now
let it be. But damn it, that's unfortunate;
my lord Grig's cursed Pensacola
business comes on this very hour,
and I'm engaged to attend—another
time—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> A short letter to Sir
William will do.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> You shall have it; yet, in
my opinion, a letter is a very bad way
of going to work; face to face, that's
my way.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> The letter sir, will do
quite as well.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Zounds, sir, do you pretend
to direct me? direct me in the business
of office? Do you know me, sir? who
am I?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Dear Mr. Lofty, this
request is not so much his as mine;
if my commands—but you despise my
power.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Delicate creature! your commands
could even control a debate at
midnight; to a power so constitutional,
I am all obedience and tranquility. He
shall have a letter; where is my secretary?
Dubardieu! And yet, I protest,
I don't like this way of doing business.
I think if I spoke first to Sir William—But
you will have it so.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Ha, ha, ha! This too is
<a id='Page_340'></a>one of my nephew's hopeful associates.
O vanity, thou constant deceiver, how
do all thy efforts to exalt, serve but to
sink us! thy false colourings, like those
employed to heighten beauty, only
seem to mend that bloom which they
contribute to destroy. I'm not displeased
at this interview; exposing
this fellow's impudence to the contempt
it deserves, may be of use to
my design; at least, if he can reflect,
it will be of use to himself.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Jarvis</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> How now, Jarvis, where's
your master my nephew?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> At his wit's end, I believe;
he's scarce gotten out of one scrape,
but he's running his head into another.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> How so?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> The house has but just been
cleared of the bailiffs, and now he's
again engaging tooth and nail in assisting
old Croaker's son to patch up a
clandestine match with the young lady
that passes in the house for his sister.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Ever busy to serve
others.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Ay, any body but himself.
The young couple, it seems, are just
setting out for Scotland, and he supplies
them with money for the journey.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Money! how is he able
to supply others, who has scarce any
for himself?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Why, there it is; he has no
money, that's true; but then, as he
never said No to any request in his
life, he has given them a bill drawn by
a friend of his upon a merchant in the
city, which I am to get changed; for
you must know that I am to go with
them to Scotland myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> How!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> It seems the young gentleman
is obliged to take a different road
<a id='Page_341'></a>from his mistress, as he is to call
upon an uncle of his that lives out of
the way, in order to prepare a place
for their reception, when they return;
so they have borrowed me from my
master, as the properest person to attend
the young lady down.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> To the land of matrimony!
A pleasant journey, Jarvis.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Ay, but I'm only to have all
the fatigues on't.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Well, it may be shorter,
and less fatiguing, than you imagine.
I know but too much of the young
lady's family and connexions, whom I
have seen abroad, I have also discovered
that Miss Richland is not
indifferent to my thoughtless nephew;
and will endeavour, though I fear in
vain, to establish that connexion. But,
come, the letter I wait for must be
almost finished; I'll let you further
into my intentions in the next room.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Scene.</span>—<span class='sc'>Croaker's</span> <i>House</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Well, sure the devil's in me
of late, for running my head in such
defiles, as nothing but a genius like
my own could draw me from. I was
formerly contented to husband out my
places and pensions with some degree
of frugality; but, curse it, of late I
have given away the whole Court Register
in less time than they could
print the title-page; yet, hang it, why
scruple a lie or two to come at a fine
girl, when I every day tell a thousand
for nothing? Ha! Honeywood here
before me. Could Miss Richland have
set him at liberty?</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Honeywood</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Honeywood, I'm glad to see
you abroad again. I find my concurrence
was not necessary in your
unfortunate affairs. I had put things
in a train to do your business; but it
is not for me to say what I intended
doing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> It was unfortunate indeed,
sir. But what adds to my uneasiness
is, that while you seem to be acquainted
with my misfortune, I, myself
continue still a stranger to my
benefactor.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> How! not know the friend
that served you?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Can't guess at the person.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Inquire.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I have, but all I can learn
is, that he chooses to remain concealed,
and that all inquiry must be fruitless.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Must be fruitless?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Absolutely fruitless.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Sure of that?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Very sure.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Then I'll be damn'd if you
shall ever know it from me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> How, sir!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> I suppose now, Mr. Honeywood,
you think my rent-roll very
considerable, and that I have vast
sums of money to throw away; I
know you do. The world, to be sure
says such things of me.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_343'></a><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> The world, by what I
learn, is no stranger to your generosity.
But where does this tend?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> To nothing; nothing in the
world. The town, to be sure, when it
makes such a thing as me the subject
of conversation, has asserted, that I
never yet patronised a man of merit.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I have heard instances to
the contrary, even from yourself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Yes, Honeywood, and there
are instances to the contrary that you
shall never hear from myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Ha, dear sir, permit me
to ask you but one question.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Sir, ask me no questions; I
say, sir, ask me no questions; I'll be
damn'd if I answer them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I will ask no further. My
friend, my benefactor, it is, it must be
here, that I am indebted for freedom
for honour. Yes, thou worthiest of
men, from the beginning I suspected
it, but was afraid to return thanks;
which, if undeserved, might seem reproaches.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> I protest I don't understand
all this, Mr. Honeywood. You treat
me very cavalierly, I do assure you, sir.—Blood,
sir, can't a man be permitted
to enjoy the luxury of his own feelings
without all this parade?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Nay, do not attempt to
conceal an action that adds to your
honour. Your looks, your air, your
manner, all confess it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Confess it sir! Torture itself,
sir, shall never bring me to confess
it. Mr. Honeywood, I have admitted
you upon terms of friendship. Don't
let us fall out; make me happy, and
let this be buried in oblivion. You
know I hate ostentation; you know I
do. Come come, Honeywood, you
know I always loved to be a friend,
and not a patron. I beg this may
<a id='Page_344'></a>make no kind of distance between us.
Come, come, you and I must be more
familiar—indeed we must.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Heavens! Can I ever repay
such friendship? Is there any
way? Thou best of men, can I ever
return the obligation?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> A bagatelle, a mere bagatelle.
But I see your heart is labouring
to be grateful. You shall be grateful.
It would be cruel to disappoint you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> How! teach me the manner.
Is there any way?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> From this moment you're
mine. Yes, my friend you shall know
it—I'm in love.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> And can I assist you?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Nobody so well.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> In what manner? I'm all
impatience.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> You shall make love for me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> And to whom shall I
speak in your favour?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> To a lady with whom you
have great interest, I assure you—Miss
Richland.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Miss Richland!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Yes, Miss Richland. She
has struck the blow up to the hilt in
my bosom, by Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Heavens was ever anything
more unfortunate? It is too much to
be endured.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Unfortunate indeed! and
yet I can endure it, till you have
opened the affair to her for me. Between
ourselves, I think she likes me;
I'm not apt to boast, but I think she
does.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Indeed! but you know the
person you apply to?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Yes, I know you are her
friend, and mine: that's enough. To
you, therefore, I commit the success of
my passion. I'll say no more, let
friendship do the rest. I have only
<a id='Page_345'></a>to add, that if at any time my little
interest can be of service—but, hang
it, I'll make no promises—you know
my interest is yours at any time. No
apologies, my friend; I'll not be answered;
it shall be so.</p>

his favour. And yet to see her in the
possession of another!—Insupportable.
But then to betray a generous, trusting

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Why, to be sure, madam,
I did hear him say, a little snubbing
before marriage would teach you to
bear it the better afterwards.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> To be gone a full hour,
though he had only to get a bill changed
in the city! How provoking!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> I'll lay my life Mr. Leontine,
that had twice as much to do, is
setting off by this time from his inn,
and here you are left behind.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Well, let us be prepared
for his coming, however. Are you
sure you have omitted nothing, Garnet?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Not a stick, madam—all's
here. Yet I wish you could take the
white and silver to be married in. It's
the worst luck in the world, in any
thing but white. I knew one Bet
Stubbs, of our town, that was married
in red, and, as sure as eggs is eggs,
the bridegroom and she had a miff before
morning.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> No matter—I'm all impatience

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Bless me, madam, I had

fancy.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> How! What's the matter?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Money, money, is the matter,
madam. We have got no money.
<a id='Page_347'></a>What the plague do you send me of
your fool's errand for? My master's

for Patagonia upon a cork jacket.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Such a disappointment!
What a base insincere man was your
master, to serve us in this manner! Is
this his good-nature?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Nay, don't talk ill of my
master, madam: I won't bear to hear
any body talk ill of him but myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Bless us! now I think on't,
madam, you need not be under any
uneasiness: I saw Mr. Leontine receive
forty guineas from his father just before
he set out, and he can't yet have
left the inn. A short letter will reach
him there.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Well remembered, Garnet;
I'll write immediately. How's this?
Bless me, my hand trembles so I can't
write a word. Do you write, Garnet;
and, upon second thought, it will be
better from you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Truly, madam, I write and
indite but poorly: I never was cute at
my larning. But I'll do what I can to
please you. Let me see. All out of
my own head, I suppose?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Whatever you please.</p>

I can trust none of the servants of this

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Garnet.</span> Odso, Madam, Mr. Honeywood's

any body we can trust will do. <i>Exit</i>
<span class='sc'>Garnet</span>. Well, Jarvis, now we can
have nothing more to interrupt us.
You may take up the things, and carry
them on to the inn. Have you no
hands, Jarvis?</p>

You, that are going to be married,
think things can never be done too
fast: but we that are old, and know
what we are about must elope methodically,
madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Well, sure, if my indiscretions
were to be done over again—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> My life for it you would do
them ten times over.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Why will you talk so? If
you knew how unhappy they make
me—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Very unhappy, no doubt:
I was once just as unhappy when I
was going to be married myself. I'll
tell you a story about that—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> A story! when I'm all impatient
to be away. Was there ever
such a dilatory creature?—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Well, madam, if we must

Though, odds-bobs we have still forgot

As sure as death, Mr. Honeywood's

the door. There's old Croaker has

he was broke loose from Bedlam about
it, but he can't find what it means for
all that. O Lud, he is coming this

Are all the horrors of air, fire, and

only to be singled out for gunpowder-plots,
combustibles and conflagration?
Here it is—An incendiary letter
dropped at my door. 'To Muster
Croaker, these, with speed.' Ay, ay,
plain enough the direction: all in the
genuine incendiary spelling, and as
cramp as the devil, 'With speed!'
O, confound your speed. But let me
read it once more. (<i>Reads</i>). 'Muster
Croakar as sone as yoew see this leve
twenty gunnes at the bar of the
Talboot tell caled for or yowe and
yower experetion will be al blown

gunpowder in every line of it. Blown
up! murderous dog! All blown up!
Heavens! what have I and my poor
family done, to be all blown up!
(<i>Reads</i>). 'Our pockets are low, and
money we must have.' Ay, there's
the reason; they'll blow us up, because
they have got low pockets. (<i>Reads</i>).
'It is but a short time you have to
consider; for if it takes wind, the house
will quickly be all of a flame.' Inhuman
monsters! blow us up, and
then burn us. The earthquake at Lisbon
was but a bonfire to it. (<i>Reads</i>).
'Make quick dispatch, and so no more
at present. But may cupid, the little
God of Love, go with you wherever
you go.' The little God of Love!
Cupid, the little God of Love go with
me! Go you to the devil, you and
your little Cupid together; I'm so
frightened, I scarce know whether I
sit, stand, or go. Perhaps this moment
I'm treading on lighted matches, blazing
brimstone, and barrels of gunpowder.
They are preparing to blow
me up into the clouds. Murder! We

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Richland</span></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Lord, sir, what's the
matter?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Murder's the matter. We
shall be all blown up in our beds before
morning.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I hope not, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> What signifies what you
hope, madam, when I have a certificate
of it here in my hand? Will nothing
alarm my family? Sleeping and
eating, sleeping and eating, is the only
work from morning till night in my
house. My insensible crew could
<a id='Page_351'></a>sleep, though rocked by an earthquake;
and fry beef-steaks at a volcano.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> But, sir, you have
alarmed them so often already, we
have nothing but earthquakes, famines,
plagues, and mad dogs, from year's end
to years' end. You remember, sir, it
is not above a month ago you assured
us of a conspiracy among the bakers,
to poison us in our bread; and so kept
the whole family a week upon potatoes.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> And potatoes were too
good for them. But why do I stand
talking here with a girl, when I should
be facing the enemy without? Here,
John, Nicodemus, search the house.
Look into the cellars, to see if there be
any combustibles below; and above,
in the apartments, that no matches
be thrown in at the windows. Let
all the fires be put out, and let the
engine be drawn out in the yard, to
play upon the house in case of necessity.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> What can he mean by
all this? Yet, why should I inquire,
when he alarms us in this manner
almost every day? But Honeywood
has desired an interview with me in
private. What can he mean? or,
rather, what means this palpitation at
his approach? It is the first time he
ever showed anything in his conduct
that seemed particular. Sure he cannot
mean to——but he's here.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Honeywood</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I presumed to solicit this
interview, madam, before I left town,
to be permitted—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Indeed! Leaving town,
sir?—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Yes, madam; perhaps the
kingdom. I have presumed, I say, to
desire the favour of this interview—in
<a id='Page_352'></a>order to disclose something which our
long friendship prompts. And yet
my fears—</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span>—"<i>It's your supreme pleasure<br />to give me no better consolation?</i>"—<i>p.</i> 307.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> His fears! what are
his fears to mine? <i>Aside.</i>—We have
indeed been long acquainted, sir; very
long. If I remember, our first meeting
was at the French ambassador's.—Do
<a id='Page_353'></a>you recollect how you were pleased
to rally me upon my complexion there?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Perfectly, madam; I presumed
to reprove you for painting:
but your warmer blushes soon convinced
the company that the colouring
was all from nature.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> And yet you only
meant it, in your good-natured way,
to make me pay a compliment to
myself. In the same manner you
danced the same night with the most
awkward woman in company, because
you saw nobody else would take her
out.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Yes; and was rewarded
the next night, by dancing with the
finest woman in company, whom every
body wished to take out.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Well, sir, if you thought
so then, I fear your judgment has since
corrected the errors of a first impression.
We generally show to most advantage
at first. Our sex are like poor
tradesmen, that put all their best goods
to be seen at the windows.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> The first impression, madam,
did, indeed, deceive me. I expected
to find a woman with all the
faults of conscious flattered beauty. I
expected to find her vain and insolent.
But every day has since taught me
that it is possible to possess sense
without pride, and beauty without
affectation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> This, sir, is a style very
unusual with Mr. Honeywood; and I
should be glad to know why he thus
attempts to increase that vanity, which
his own lesson hath taught me to
despise.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I ask pardon, madam,
Yet, from our long friendship, I presumed
I might have some right to offer,
without offence, what you may refuse
without offending.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_354'></a><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Sir! I beg you'd reflect;
though, I fear, I shall scarce have any
power to refuse a request of yours;
yet, you may be precipitate: consider,
sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I own my rashness; but,
as I plead the cause of friendship, of
one who loves—Don't be alarmed,
madam—Who loves you with the
most ardent passion; whose whole
happiness is placed in you—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> I fear, sir, I shall never
find whom you mean, by this description
of him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Ah, madam, it but too
plainly points him out; though he
should be too humble himself to urge
his pretensions, or you too modest to
understand them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Well; it would be
affectation any longer to pretend ignorance;
and, I will own, sir, I have
long been prejudiced in his favour.
It was but natural to wish to make
his heart mine, as he seemed himself
ignorant of its value.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I see she always loved
him (<i>aside</i>). I find, madam, you're
already sensible of his worth, his passion.
How happy is my friend, to be
the favourite of one with such sense
to distinguish merit, and such beauty
to reward it!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Your friend, sir! What
friend?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> My best friend—my
friend Mr. Lofty, madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> He, sir!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Yes, he, madam. He is,
indeed, what your warmest wishes
might have formed him. And to his
other qualities, he adds that of the
most passionate regard for you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Amazement!—No more
of this, I beg you, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I see your confusion,
<a id='Page_355'></a>madam, and know how to interpret it.
And since I so plainly read the language
of your heart, shall I make my
friend happy, by communicating your
sentiments?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> By no means.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Excuse me; I must—I
know you desire it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Mr. Honeywood, let
me tell you, that you wrong my sentiments
and yourself. When I first
applied to your friendship, I expected
advice and assistance; but now, sir, I
see that it is vain to expect happiness
from him who has been so bad an
economist of his own; and that I
must disclaim his friendship who ceases
to be a friend to himself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> How is this? she has
confessed she loved him, and yet she
seemed to part in displeasure. Can I
have done anything to reproach myself
with? No, I believe not; yet, after
all, these things should not be done

carried me a little too far.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Croaker</span>, <i>with the letter in his hand,
and</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Ha, ha, ha! And
so my dear, it's your supreme wish
that I should be quite wretched upon
this occasion? Ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker</span> (<i>mimicking</i>). Ha, ha, ha!
and so, my dear, it's your supreme
pleasure to give me no better consolation?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Positively, my dear,
what is this incendiary stuff and trumpery
to me? Our house may travel
through the air like the house of Loretto,
for aught I care, if I'm to be
miserable in it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Would to heaven it were
converted into a house of correction
<a id='Page_356'></a>for your benefit! Have we not everything
to alarm us? Perhaps, this very
moment the tragedy is beginning.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Then let us reserve
our distress till the rising of the curtain,
or give them the money they
want, and have done with them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Give them my money!—and
pray what right have they to
my money?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> And pray what
right then have you to my good
humour?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> And so your good humour
advises me to part with my
money? Why, then, to tell your
good humour a piece of my mind, I'd
sooner part with my wife. Here's
Mr. Honeywood, see what he'll say
to it. My dear Honeywood, look at
this incendiary letter dropped at my
door. It will freeze you with terror;
and yet lovey here can read it—can
read it, and laugh.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Yes, and so will
Mr. Honeywood.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> If he does, I'll suffer to
be hanged the next minute in the
rogue's place, that's all.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Speak, Mr. Honeywood;
is there anything more foolish
than my husband's fright upon this
occasion?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> It would not become me
to decide, madam; but, doubtless, the
greatness of his terrors now will but
invite them to renew their villainy
another time.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> I told you he'd be
of my opinion.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> How, sir! do you maintain
that I should lie down under such
an injury, and show, neither by my
tears nor complaints, that I have something
of the spirit of a man in me?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Pardon me, sir. You
<a id='Page_357'></a>ought to make the loudest complaints
if you desire redress. The surest way
to have redress, is to be earnest in the
pursuit of it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Ay, whose opinion is he
of now?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> But don't you think
that laughing off our fears is the best
way?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> What is the best, madam,
few can say; but I'll maintain it to
be a very wise way.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> But we're talking of the
best. Surely the best way is to face
the enemy in the field, and not wait
till he plunders us in our very bed-chamber.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Why, sir, as to the best,
that—that's a very wise way too.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> But can anything
be more absurd than to double our
distresses by our apprehensions, and
put it in the power of every low fellow,
that can scrawl ten words of wretched
spelling, to torment us?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Without doubt, nothing
more absurd.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> How! would it not be
more absurd to despise the rattle till
we are bit by the snake?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Without doubt, perfectly
absurd.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Then you are of my
opinion?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Entirely.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> And you reject
mine?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Heavens forbid, madam.
No; sure no reasoning can be more
just than yours. We ought certainly
to despise malice, if we cannot oppose
it, and not make the incendiary's pen
as fatal to our repose as the highwayman's
pistol.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> O! then you think
I'm quite right?</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_358'></a><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Perfectly right.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> A plague of plagues, we
can't both be right. I ought to be
sorry, or I ought to be glad. My hat
must be on my head, or my hat must
be off.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Certainly; in two
opposite opinions, if one be perfectly
reasonable, the other can't be perfectly
right.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> And why may not both
be right, madam; Mr. Croaker in
earnestly seeking redress, and you in
waiting the event with good humour?
Pray let me see the letter again. I
have it. This letter requires twenty
guineas to be left at the bar of the
Talbot inn. If it be indeed an incendiary
letter, what if you and I, sir,
go there; and when the writer comes to
be paid his expected booty, seize him?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> My dear friend, it's the
very thing; the very thing. While I
walk by the door, you shall plant yourself
in ambush near the bar; burst out
upon the miscreant like a masqued
battery; extort a confession at once,
and so hang him up by surprise.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Yes; but I would not
choose to exercise too much severity.
It is my maxim, sir, that crimes generally
punish themselves.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Well, but we may upbraid
him a little, I suppose? (<i>Ironically.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Ay, but not punish him
too rigidly.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Well, well, leave that to
my own benevolence.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Well, I do; but remember
that universal benevolence is the
first law of nature.</p>

<p class='c016'>[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class='sc'>Honeywood</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Yes; and my universal

had as many necks as a hydra.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> The horses are just finishing
their oats; and, as they are not
going to be married, they choose to
take their own time.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> You are for ever giving
wrong motives to my impatience.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Be as impatient as you
will, the horses must take their own
time; besides, you don't consider we
have got no answer from our fellow-traveller
yet. If we hear nothing from
Mr. Leontine, we have only one way
left us.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> What way?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> The way home again.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Not so. I have made a
resolution to go, and nothing shall
induce me to break it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> Ay; resolutions are well
kept when they jump with inclination.
However, I'll go hasten things without.
And I'll call too at the bar to
see if anything should be left for us
there. Don't be in such a plaguy
hurry, madam, and we shall go the
faster, I promise you.</p>

<p class='c016'>[<i>Exit</i> <span class='sc'>Jarvis</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Landlady</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Landlady.</span> What! Solomon; why
don't you move? Pipes and tobacco
for the Lamb there. Will nobody

The Angel has been outrageous this
half-hour. Did your ladyship call,
madam?</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_360'></a><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> No, madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Landlady.</span> I find, as you're for
Scotland, madam—but that's no business
of mine; married or not married,
I ask no questions. To be sure, we
had a sweet little couple set off from
this two days ago for the same place.
The gentleman, for a tailor, was, to be
sure, as fine a spoken tailor as ever
blew froth from a full pot. And the
young lady so bashful, it was near
half an hour before we could get her
to finish a pint of raspberry between
us.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> But this gentleman and I
are not going to be married, I assure
you</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Landlady.</span> May be not. That's
no business of mine; for certain,
Scotch marriages seldom turn out.
There was, of my own knowledge,
Miss Macfag, that married her father's
footman. Alack-a-day! she and her
husband soon parted, and now keep
separate cellars in Hedge-lane.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> A very pretty picture of
what lies before me.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Leontine</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> My dear Olivia, my anxiety
till you were out of danger, was too
great to be resisted. I could not help
coming to see you set out, though it
exposes us to a discovery.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> May everything you do
prove as fortunate. Indeed, Leontine,
we have been most cruelly disappointed.
Mr. Honeywood's bill upon
the city has, it seems, been protested;
<a id='Page_361'></a>and we have been utterly at a loss
how to proceed.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> How! An offer of his own
too. Sure, he could not mean to deceive
us.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Depend upon his sincerity;
he only mistook the desire for the
power of serving us. But let us think
no more of it. I believe the post-chaise
is ready by this.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Landlady.</span> Not quite yet; and,
begging your ladyship's pardon, I
don't think your ladyship quite ready
for the post-chaise. The north road
is a cold place, madam. I have a drop
in the house of as pretty raspberry as
ever was tipt over tongue. Just a
thimblefull, to keep the wind off your
stomach. To be sure, the last couple
we had here, they said it was a perfect
nosegay. Ecod, I sent them both
away as good-natured—Up went the
blinds, round went the wheels, and,
Drive away, postboy! was the word.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Croaker</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Well, while my friend
Honeywood is upon the post of danger
at the bar, it must be my business to
have an eye about me here. I think
I know an incendiary's look; for,
wherever the devil makes a purchase,
he never fails to set his mark. Ha!
who have we here? My son and
daughter! What can they be doing
here?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Landlady.</span> I tell you, madam, it
will do you good; I think I know by
this time what's good for the north
road. It's a raw night, madam.—Sir—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Not a drop more, good
madam. I should now take it as a
greater favour if you hasten the horses;
for I am afraid to be seen myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Landlady.</span> That shall be done.
<a id='Page_362'></a>Wha, Solomon! are you all dead
there? Wha, Solomon, I say.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Well; I dread, lest an
expedition begun in fear should end in
repentance.—Every moment we stay
increases our danger, and adds to my
apprehensions.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> There's no danger, trust
me, my dear; there can be none. If
Honeywood has acted with honour,
and kept my father, as he promised,
in employment, till we are out of
danger, nothing can interrupt our
journey.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> I have no doubt of Mr.
Honeywood's sincerity, and even his
desires to serve us. My fears are
from your father's suspicions. A
mind so disposed to be alarmed without
a cause will be but too ready
when there's a reason.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Why, let him, when we are
out of his power. But, believe me,
Olivia, you have no great reason to
dread his resentment. His repining
temper, as it does no manner of injury
to himself, so will it never do harm to
others. He only frets to keep himself
employed, and scolds for his private
amusement.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> I don't know that; but
I'm sure, on some occasions, it makes
him look most shockingly.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker</span> (<i>discovering himself</i>). How
does he look now?—How does he
look now?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Ah!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Undone.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> How do I look now?
Sir, I am your very humble servant.
Madam, I am yours. What! you are
going off, are you? Then, first, if you
please, take a word or two from me
with you before you go. Tell me first
where you are going; and when you

I'll not bear it. Honeywood is a
friend to the family, and I'll have him
treated as such.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> I shall study to repay his
friendship as it deserves.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Ah, rogue, if you knew
how earnestly he entered into my
griefs, and pointed out the means to
detect them, you would love him as I
do. <i>A cry without, Stop him!</i> Fire
and fury! they have seized the incendiary:
they have the villain, the incendiary
in view. Stop him, stop an
incendiary, a murderer! stop him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Oh, my terrors! What
can this new tumult mean?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Some new mark, I suppose,
of Mr. Honeywood's sincerity. But
we shall have satisfaction: he shall
give me instant satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> It must not be, my Leontine,
if you value my esteem, or my
happiness. Whatever be our fate, let
us not add guilt to our misfortunes.
Consider that our innocence will
<a id='Page_365'></a>shortly be all we have left us. You
must forgive him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Forgive him! Has he not
in every instance betrayed us? Forced
me to borrow money from him, which
appears a mere trick to delay us:
promised to keep my father engaged,
till we were out of danger, and here
brought him to the very scene of our
escape?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Don't be precipitate. We

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Postboy</span>, <i>dragging in</i> <span class='sc'>Jarvis</span>: <span class='sc'>Honeywood</span>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Postboy.</span> Ay, master, we have him
fast enough. Here is the incendiary
dog. I'm entitled to the reward; I'll
take my oath I saw him ask for the
money at the bar, and then run for it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Come, bring him along.
Let us see him. Let him learn to
blush for his crimes. (<i>Discovering his
mistake.</i>) Death! what's here?—Jarvis,
Leontine, Olivia! What can
all this mean?</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Jarvis.</i> Why, I'll tell you what it
means: that I was an old fool, and
that you are my master—that's all.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Confusion.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Yes, sir; I find you have
kept your word with me. After such
baseness, I wonder how you can
venture to see the man you have
injured.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> My dear Leontine, by my
life, my honour—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Peace, peace, for shame;
and do not continue to aggravate
baseness by hypocrisy. I know you,
sir, I know you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Why, won't you hear me?
By all that's just, I knew not—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> Hear you, sir, to what purpose?
I now see through all your
low arts; your ever complying with
<a id='Page_366'></a>every opinion; your never refusing
any request; your friendship is as
common as a prostitute's favours, and
as fallacious; all these, sir, have long
been contemptible to the world, and
are now perfectly so to me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Ha! contemptible to the
world! That reaches me.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> All the seeming sincerity of
your professions, I now find, were
only allurements to betray; and all
your seeming regret for their consequences,
only calculated to cover
the cowardice of your heart. Draw,
villain!</p>

one of the company.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> How!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Mr. Croaker, we have all
been under a strange mistake here: I
find there is nobody guilty; it was all
an error; entirely an error of our own.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_367'></a><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> And I say, sir, that you're
in an error: for there's guilt, and
double guilt; a plot, a damn'd jesuitical,
pestilential plot; and I must
have proof of it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Do but hear me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> What! you intend to
bring 'em off, I suppose? I'll hear
nothing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Madam, you seem at

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Excuse me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Good Jarvis, let me then
explain it to you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jarvis.</span> What signifies explanation,
when the thing is done?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Will nobody hear me?
Was there ever such a set, so blinded
by passion and prejudice!—(<i>To the</i>
<span class='sc'>Postboy</span>). My good friend, I believe
you'll be surprised when I assure
you——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Postboy.</span> Sure me nothing—I'm
sure of nothing but a good beating.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Come then, you, madam;
if you ever hope for any favour or forgiveness,
tell me sincerely all you
know of this affair.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Unhappily, sir, I'm but too
much the cause of your suspicions;
you see before you, sir, one, that
with false pretences has stept into
your family, to betray it: not your
daughter—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Not my daughter!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Olivia.</span> Not your daughter—but a
mean deceiver—who—support me, I
cannot—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Help, she's going! give
her air.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Ay, ay, take the young

neither.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Yes, yes, all's out; I now
<a id='Page_368'></a>see the whole affair; my son is either
married, or going to be so, to this
lady, whom he imposed upon me as
his sister. Ay, certainly so; and yet
I don't find it afflicts me so much as
one might think. There's the advantage
of fretting away our misfortunes
beforehand, we never feel them when
they come.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Richland</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Sir William</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> But how do you know,
madam, that my nephew intends setting
off from this place?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> My maid assured me
he was come to this inn, and my own
knowledge of his intending to leave
the kingdom, suggested the rest. But
what do I see? my guardian here
before us! Who, my dear sir, could
have expected meeting you here? to
what accident do we owe this pleasure?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> To a fool, I believe.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> But to what purpose
did you come?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> To play the fool.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> But with whom?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> With greater fools than
myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Explain.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Why, Mr. Honeywood
brought me here, to do nothing now I
am here; and my son is going to be
married to I don't know who that is
here; so now you are as wise as I am.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Married! to whom,
sir?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> To Olivia; my daughter,
as I took her to be; but who the
devil she is, or whose daughter she is,
I know no more than the man in the
moon.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Then, sir, I can inform
you; and though a stranger, yet you
shall find me a friend to your family:
it will be enough at present to assure
<a id='Page_369'></a>you, that, both in point of birth and
fortune, the young lady is at least
your son's equal. Being left by her
father, Sir James Woodville—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Sir James Woodville!
What of the west!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Being left by him, I say,
to the care of a mercenary wretch,
whose only aim was to secure her
fortune to himself, she was sent into
France, under pretence of education;
and there every art was tried to fix
her for life in a convent, contrary to
her inclinations. Of this I was informed
upon my arrival at Paris; and
as I had been once her father's friend,
I did all in my power to frustrate her
guardian's base intentions. I had
even meditated to rescue her from his
authority, when your son stept in with
more pleasing violence, gave her
liberty, and you a daughter.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> But I intend to have a
daughter of my own choosing, sir. A
young lady, sir, whose fortune, by my
interest with those that have interest,
will be double what my son has a
right to expect. Do you know Mr.
Lofty, sir?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Yes, sir; and know that
you are deceived in him. But step
this way, and I'll convince you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Sir William</span> <i>seem to confer</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Honeywood</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Obstinate man, still to
persist in his outrage! Insulted by
him, despised by all, I now begin to
grow contemptible even to myself.
How have I sunk, by too great an
assiduity to please! How have I
overtaxed all my abilities, lest the
approbation of a single fool should
escape me! But all is now over; I
have survived my reputation, my
fortune, my friendships; and nothing
<a id='Page_370'></a>remains henceforward for me but
solitude and repentance.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Is it true, Mr. Honeywood,
that you are setting off, without
taking leave of your friends? The
report is, that you are quitting
England. Can it be?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Yes, madam; and though
I am so unhappy as to have fallen
under your displeasure, yet, thank
Heaven, I leave you to happiness; to
one who loves you, and deserves your
love; to one who has power to procure
you affluence, and generosity to improve
your enjoyment of it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> And are you sure, sir,
that the gentleman you mean is what
you describe him?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> I have the best assurances
of it, his serving me. He does, indeed,
deserve the highest happiness, and that
is in your power to confer. As for me,
weak and wavering as I have been,
obliged by all and incapable of serving
any, what happiness can I find, but in
solitude? What hope, but in being
forgotten?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> A thousand! to live
among friends that esteem you; whose
happiness it will be to be permitted
to oblige you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> No, madam; my resolution
is fixed. Inferiority among
strangers is easy; but among those
that once were equals, insupportable.
Nay, to show you how far my resolution
can go, I can now speak with
calmness of my former follies, my
vanity, my dissipation, my weakness.
I will even confess, that, among the
number of my other presumptions, I
had the insolence to think of loving
you. Yes, madam, while I was pleading
the passion of another, my heart
was tortured with its own. But it is
<a id='Page_371'></a>over, it was unworthy our friendship,
and let it be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> You amaze me!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> But you'll forgive it, I
know you will; since the confession
should not have come from me even
now, but to convince you of the sincerity
of my intention of—never
mentioning it more.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Going.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Stay, sir, one moment—Ha!
he here—</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Lofty</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Is the coast clear? None
but friends. I have followed you here
with a trifling piece of intelligence:
but it goes no farther; things are not
yet ripe for a discovery. I have
spirits working at a certain board:
your affair at the treasury will be done
in less than—a thousand years. Mum!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> Sooner, sir, I should
hope.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Why, yes, I believe it may,
if it falls into proper hands, that know
where to push and where to parry;
that know how the land lies—eh,
Honeywood?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> It is fallen into yours.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Well, to keep you no longer
in suspense, your thing is done. It is
done, I say—that's all. I have just
had assurances of Lord Neverout,
that the claim has been examined, and
found admissible. <i>Quietus</i> is the word,
madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> But how! his lordship
has been at Newmarket these ten
days.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Indeed. Then Sir Gilbert
Goose must have been most damnably
mistaken. I had it of him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> He! why Sir Gilbert
and his family have been in the country
this month.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> This month! It must certainly
<a id='Page_372'></a>be so—Sir Gilbert's letter did
come to me from Newmarket, so that
he must have met his lordship there;
and so it came about. I have this
letter about me; I'll read it to you
(<i>Taking out a large bundle.</i>) That's
from Paoli of Corsica; that's from the
Marquis of Squilachi. Have you a
mind to see a letter from Count Poniatowski,
now king of Poland—Honest
Pon—— (<i>Searching.</i>) O, sir, what are
you here too? I'll tell you what,
honest friend, if you have not absolutely
delivered my letter to Sir William
Honeywood, you may return it.
The thing will do without him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Sir, I have delivered it,
and must inform you, it was received
with the most mortifying contempt.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Contempt! Mr. Lofty,
what can that mean?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Let him go on, let him go
on, I say. You'll find it come to something
presently.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Yes, sir, I believe you'll
be amazed, if, after waiting some time
in the ante-chamber; after being surveyed
with insolent curiosity by the
passing servants, I was at last assured,
that Sir William Honeywood knew no
such person, and I must certainly have
been imposed upon.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Good; let me die, very good.
Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Now, for my life, I can't
find out half the goodness of it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> You can't. Ha! ha!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> No, for the soul of me;
I think it was as confounded a bad
answer, as ever was sent from one private
gentleman to another.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> And so you can't find out
the force of the message? Why, I
was in the house at that very time.
Ha! ha! It was I that sent that very
answer to my own letter. Ha! ha!</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Indeed? How! why!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> In one word, things between
Sir William and me, must
be behind the curtain. A party

Buzzard; I side with Sir Gilbert

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_374'></a><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> And so it does, indeed,
and all my suspicions are over.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Your suspicions? What,
then, you have been suspecting, have
you? Mr. Croaker, you and I were
friends; we are friends no longer.
Never talk to me. It's over; I say,
it's over.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> As I hope for your favour,
I did not mean to offend. It
escaped me. Don't be discomposed.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Zounds, sir, but I am discomposed,
and will be discomposed.
To be treated thus! Who am I?
Was it for this I have been dreaded
both by ins and outs? Have I been
libelled in the Gazetteer, and praised
in the St. James's? Have I been
cheered at Wildman's, and a speaker
at Merchant Tailors' Hall? Have I
had my hand to addresses, and my
head in the print-shops; and talk to
me of suspects?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> My dear sir, be pacified.
What can you have but asking pardon?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Sir, I will not be pacified.—Suspects!
Who am I? To be used
thus, have I paid court to men in favour
to serve my friends, the lords of the
treasury, Sir William Honeywood, and
the rest of the gang, and talk to me
of suspects? Who am I, I say? who
am I?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Since, sir, you're so
pressing for an answer, I'll tell you
who you are—a gentleman, as well acquainted
with politics as with men in
power; as well acquainted with persons
of fashion as with modesty; with
lords of the treasury as with truth;
and with all as you are with Sir William
Honeywood. I am Sir William
Honeywood.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Discovering his ensigns of the Bath.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Sir William Honeywood!</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_375'></a><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Astonishment! my uncle!</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> So then, my confounded
genius has been all this time only leading
me up to the garret, in order to
fling me out of the window.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> What, Mr. Importance,
and are these your works? Suspect
you! You, who have been dreaded
by the ins and outs: you, who have
had your hand to addresses, and your
head stuck up in print-shops. If you
were served right, you should have
your head stuck up in the pillory.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Ay, stick it where you will;
for, by the Lord, it cuts but a very
poor figure where it sticks at present.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Well, Mr. Croaker, I
hope you now see how incapable this
gentleman is of serving you, and how
little Miss Richland has to expect from
his influence.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Ay, sir, too well I see it,
and I can't but say I have had some
boding of it these ten days. So I'm
resolved, since my son has placed his
affections on a lady of moderate fortune,
to be satisfied with his choice,
and not run the hazard of another Mr.
Lofty in helping him to a better.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> I approve your resolution;
and here they come, to receive
a confirmation of your pardon and
consent.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker</span>, <span class='sc'>Jarvis</span>, <span class='sc'>Leontine</span>,
<span class='sc'>Olivia</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Croaker.</span> Where's my husband?
Come, come, lovey, you must
forgive them. Jarvis here has been to
tell me the whole affair; and, I say,
you must forgive them. Our own was
a stolen match, you know, my dear;
and we never had any reason to repent
of it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> I wish we could both say
so: however, this gentleman, Sir William
<a id='Page_376'></a>Honeywood, has been beforehand
with you in obtaining their pardon.
So, if the two poor fools have a mind
to marry, I think we can tack them
together without crossing the Tweed
for it.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Joining their hands.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leont.</span> How blest and unexpected!
What, what can we say to such goodness?
But our future obedience shall
be the best reply. And as for this
gentleman, to whom we owe——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Excuse me sir, if I interrupt
your thanks, as I have here an
interest that calls me. (<i>Turning to</i>
<span class='sc'>Honeywood</span>.) Yes, sir, you are surprised
to see me; and I own that a
desire of correcting your follies led
me hither. I saw with indignation
the errors of a mind that only sought
applause from others; that easiness of
disposition which, though inclined to
the right, had not courage to condemn
the wrong. I saw with regret those
splendid errors, that still took name
from some neighbouring duty. Your
charity, that was but injustice; your
benevolence, that was but weakness;
and your friendship but credulity. I
saw, with regret, great talents and
extensive learning only employed to
add sprightliness to error, and increase
your perplexities. I saw your mind,
with a thousand natural charms; but
the greatness of its beauty served only
to heighten my pity for its prostitution.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Cease to upbraid me, sir:
I have for some time but too strongly
felt the justice of your reproaches;
but there is one way still left me.
Yes, sir, I have determined this very
hour to quit for ever, a place where I
have made myself the voluntary slave
of all; and to seek among strangers
that fortitude which may give strength
to the mind, and marshal all its dissipated
virtues. Yet, ere I depart, permit
<a id='Page_377'></a>me to solicit favour for this gentleman;
who, notwithstanding what
has happened, has laid me under the
most signal obligations. Mr. Lofty—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lofty.</span> Mr. Honeywood, I am resolved
upon a reformation, as well as
you. I now begin to find, that the
man who first invented the art of
speaking truth, was a much cunninger
fellow than I thought him. And to
prove that I design to speak truth for
the future, I must now assure you that
you owe your late enlargement to
another; as, upon my soul, I had no
hand in the matter. So now, if any
of the company has a mind for preferment,
he may take my place. I
am determined to resign.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> How have I been deceived!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> No, sir, you have been
obliged to a kinder, fairer friend for
that favour—to Miss Richland. Would
she complete our joy, and make the
man she has honoured by her friendship
happy in her love, I should then
forget all, and be as blest as the welfare
of my dearest kinsman can make
me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Rich.</span> After what is past, it
would be but affectation to pretend to
indifference. Yes, I will own an attachment,
which, I find, was more than
friendship. And if my entreaties cannot
alter his resolution to quit the
country, I will even try if my hand
has not power to detain him.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Giving her hand.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Heavens! how can I have
deserved all this? How express my
happiness, my gratitude! A moment
like this overpays an age of apprehension.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Croaker.</span> Well, now I see content
in every face; but Heaven send we be
all better this day three months.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_378'></a><span class='sc'>Sir Will.</span> Henceforth, nephew,
learn to respect yourself. He who seeks
only for applause from without, has
all his happiness in another's keeping.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Honeyw.</span> Yes, sir, I now too plainly
perceive my errors. My vanity, in attempting
to please all, by fearing to
offend any. My meanness in approving
folly, lest fools should disapprove.
Henceforth, therefore, it shall be my
study to reserve my pity for real distress;
my friendship for true merit;
and my love for her who first taught
me what it is to be happy.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>TO SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='c016'>By inscribing this slight performance to you, I do not mean so much
to compliment you as myself. It may do me some honour to inform the
public, that I have lived many years in intimacy with you. It may
serve the interests of mankind also to inform them, that the greatest
wit may be found in a character, without impairing the most unaffected
piety.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have, particularly, reason to thank you for your partiality to this
performance. The undertaking a Comedy not merely sentimental, was very
dangerous; and Mr. Colman, who saw this piece in its various stages,
always thought it so. However, I ventured to trust it to the public;
and though it was necessarily delayed till late in the season, I have
every reason to be grateful.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

</div>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>ACT I.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Scene.</span>—<i>A scene in an old-fashioned house.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Hardcastle</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Mr. Hardcastle</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> I vow, Mr. Hardcastle,
you're very particular. Is there a
creature in the whole country, but
ourselves, that does not take a trip
to town now and then to rub off
the rust a little? There's the two
Miss Hoggs, and our neighbour Mrs.
Grisby, go to take a month's polishing
every winter.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Ay, and bring back vanity
and affectation to last them the whole
year. I wonder why London cannot
keep its own fools at home. In my
time, the follies of the town crept
slowly among us, but now they travel
faster than a stage-coach. Its fopperies
come down, not only as inside
passengers, but in the very basket.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Ay, <i>your</i> times were
fine times, indeed; you have been
telling us of <i>them</i> for many a long
year. Here we live in an old rambling
mansion, that looks for all the
world like an inn, but that we never
see company. Our best visitors are old
Mrs. Oddfish, the curate's wife, and
little Cripplegate, the lame dancing-master;
and all our entertainment,
<a id='Page_384'></a>your old stories of Prince Eugene and
the Duke of Marlborough. I hate
such old-fashioned trumpery.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> And I love it. I love
everything that's old: old friends, old
times, old manners, old books, old
wine; and, I believe, Dorothy (<i>taking
her hand</i>), you'll own I have been
pretty fond of an old wife.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Lord, Mr. Hardcastle,
you're for ever at your Dorothys, and
your old wives. You may be a Darby,
but I'll be no Joan, I promise you.
I'm not so old as you'd make me,
by more than one good year. Add
twenty to twenty, and make money
of that.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Let me see; twenty added
to twenty, makes just fifty and
seven.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> It's false, Mr. Hardcastle:
I was but twenty when I was
brought to bed of Tony, that I had
by Mr. Lumpkin, my first husband;
and he's not come to years of discretion
yet.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Nor ever will, I dare answer
for him. Ay, you have taught <i>him</i>
finely.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> No matter, Tony
Lumpkin has a good fortune. My
son is not to live by his learning.
I don't think a boy wants much
learning to spend fifteen hundred
a-year.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Learning, quotha! a mere
composition of tricks and mischief.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Humour, my dear:
nothing but humour. Come, Mr.
Hardcastle, you must allow the boy
a little humour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I'd sooner allow him a
horse-pond. If burning the footmen's
shoes, frighting the maids, worrying
the kittens—be humour, he has it.
It was but yesterday he fastened
<a id='Page_385'></a>my wig to the back of my chair,
and when I went to make a bow, I
popt my bald head in Mrs. Frizzle's
face.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> And am I to blame?
The poor boy was always too sickly
to do any good. A school would be
his death. When he comes to be a
little stronger, who knows what a year
or two's Latin may do for him!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Latin for him! A cat and
fiddle. No, no, the alehouse and the
stable are the only schools he'll ever
go to.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Well, we must not
snub the poor boy now, for I believe
we shan't have him long among us.
Anybody that looks in his face may
see he's consumptive.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Ay, if growing too fat be
one of the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> He coughs sometimes.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Yes, when his liquor goes
the wrong way.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> I'm actually afraid of
his lungs.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> And truly so am I; for he
sometimes whoops like a speaking
trumpet—(<i>Tony hallooing behind the
scenes</i>)—O there he goes—A very
consumptive figure, truly.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Tony</span>, <i>crossing the stage</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Tony, where are you
going, my charmer? Won't you give
papa and I a little of your company,
lovee?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> I'm in haste, mother, I
cannot stay.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> You shan't venture
out this raw evening, my dear; you
look most shockingly.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> I can't stay, I tell you. The
Three Pigeons expects me down every
moment. There's some fun going
forward.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_386'></a><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Ay; the alehouse, the old
place: I thought so.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> A low, paltry set of
fellows.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Not so low neither. There's
Dick Muggins the exciseman, Jack
Slang the horse-doctor, little Aminadab,
that grinds the music-box, and
Tom Twist, that spins the pewter
platter.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Pray, my dear, disappoint
them for one night at least.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> As for disappointing <i>them</i>,
I should not so much mind; but I
can't abide to disappoint <i>myself</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> (<i>Detaining him.</i>) You
shan't go.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> I will, I tell you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> I say you shan't.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> We'll see which is the
strongest, you or I!</p>

    <div><i>Exit, hauling her out.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hardcastle</span>, <i>solus</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Ay, there goes a pair that
only spoil each other; but is not the
whole age in a combination to drive
sense and discretion out of doors?
There's my pretty darling Kate; the
fashions of the times have almost
infected her too. By living a year or
two in town, she is as fond of gauze,
and French frippery, as the best of
them.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Hardcastle</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Blessings on my pretty
innocence! Drest out as usual, my
Kate. Goodness! What a quantity of
superfluous silk hast thou got about
thee, girl! I could never teach the
fools of this age, that the indigent
world could be clothed out of the
trimmings of the vain.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> You know our agreement,
sir. You allow me the morning
to receive and pay visits, and to
<a id='Page_387'></a>dress in my own manner; and in the
evening, I put on my housewife's
dress to please you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Well, remember I insist on
the terms of our agreement; and, by
the by, I believe I shall have occasion
to try your obedience this very
evening.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I protest, sir, I don't
comprehend your meaning.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Then, to be plain with you,
Kate, I expect the young gentleman
I have chosen to be your husband
from town this very day. I have his
father's letter, in which he informs me
his son is set out, and that he intends
to follow himself shortly after.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Indeed! I wish I
had known something of this before.
Bless me, how shall I behave! It's
a thousand to one I shan't like him;
our meeting will be so formal, and
so like a thing of business, that I
shall find no room for friendship or
esteem.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Depend upon it, child, I'll
never control your choice; but Mr.
Marlow, whom I have pitched upon,
is the son of my old friend, Sir
Charles Marlow, of whom you have
heard me talk so often. The young
gentleman has been bred a scholar,
and is designed for an employment
in the service of his country. I
am told he's a man of an excellent
understanding.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Is he?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Very generous.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I believe I shall like
him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Young and brave.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I'm sure I shall like
him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> And very handsome.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> My dear papa, say no
<a id='Page_388'></a>more (<i>kissing his hand</i>), he's mine, I'll
have him!</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> And to crown all, Kate,
he's one of the most bashful and
reserved young fellows in all the
world.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Eh! you have frozen
me to death again. That word <i>reserved</i>,
<a id='Page_389'></a>has undone all the rest of his
accomplishments. A reserved lover,
it is said, always makes a suspicious
husband.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> On the contrary, modesty
seldom resides in a breast that is not
enriched with nobler virtues. It was
the very feature in his character that
first struck me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> He must have more
striking features to catch me, I promise
you. However, if he be so young, so
handsome, and so everything, as you
mention, I believe he'll do still. I
think I'll have him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Ay, Kate, but there is still
an obstacle. It's more than an even
wager, he may not have <i>you</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> My dear papa, why
will you mortify one so!—Well, if he
refuses, instead of breaking my heart
at his indifference, I'll only break my
glass for its flattery, set my cap to
some newer fashion, and look out for
some less difficult admirer.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Bravely resolved! In the
meantime I'll go prepare the servants
for his reception; as we seldom see
company, they want as much training
as a company of recruits the first
day's muster.</p>

these he put last; but
I put them foremost. Sensible—good-natured:
I like all that. But
then—reserved, and sheepish: that's
much against him. Yet, can't he be
cur'd of his timidity, by being taught
to be proud of his wife? Yes; and
can't I—But, I vow, I'm disposing of
the husband, before I have secured
the lover.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_390'></a><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Neville</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I'm glad you're come,
Neville, my dear. Tell me, Constance:
how do I look this evening? Is there
anything whimsical about me? Is it
one of my well-looking days, child?
Am I in face to-day?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Perfectly, my dear.
Yet, now I look again—bless me!—sure
no accident has happened among
the canary birds, or the gold fishes.
Has your brother or the cat been
meddling? Or, has the last novel
been too moving?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> No; nothing of all
this. I have been threatened—I can
scarce get it out—I have been threatened
with a lover.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> And his name—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Is Marlow.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Indeed!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> The son of Sir Charles
Marlow.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> As I live, the most intimate
friend of Mr. Hastings, <i>my</i>
admirer. They are never asunder.
I believe you must have seen him
when we lived in town.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Never.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> He's a very singular
character, I assure you. Among
women of reputation and virtue, he is
the modestest man alive; but his acquaintance
give him a very different
character among creatures of another
stamp: you understand me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> An odd character,
indeed. I shall never be able to
manage him. What shall I do?
Pshaw, think no more of him, but
trust to occurrences for success. But
how goes on your own affair, my
dear? has my mother been courting
you for my brother Tony, as usual!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> I have just come from
one of our agreeable tête-à-têtes.
<a id='Page_391'></a>She has been saying a hundred tender
things, and setting off her pretty
monster as the very pink of perfection.</p>

</div>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> And her partiality is
such, that she actually thinks him so.
A fortune like yours is no small temptation.
Besides, as she has the sole
<a id='Page_392'></a>management of it, I'm not surprised
to see her unwilling to let it go out of
the family.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> A fortune like mine,
which chiefly consists in jewels, is no
such mighty temptation. But, at any
rate, if my dear Hastings be but constant,
I make no doubt to be too hard
for her at last. However, I let her
suppose that I am in love with her
son, and she never once dreams that
my affections are fixed upon another.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> My good brother holds
out stoutly. I could almost love him
for hating you so.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> It is a good-natured
creature at bottom, and I'm sure
would wish to see me married to anybody
but himself. But my aunt's
bell rings for our afternoon's walk
round the improvements. <i>Allons!</i>
Courage is necessary, as our affairs

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>2 Fel.</span> O he takes after his own

'squire Lumpkin was the finest gentleman
I ever set my eyes on. For
winding the straight horn, or beating
<a id='Page_394'></a>a thicket for a hare, or a wench, he
never had his fellow. It was a saying
in the place, that he kept the best
horses, dogs, and girls in the whole

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Ecod, and when I'm of age

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Land.</span> There be two gentlemen in a

they are talking something about Mr.
Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> As sure as can be, one of
them must be the gentleman that's
coming down to court my sister.—Do
they seem to be Londoners?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Land.</span> I believe they may. They

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Then desire them to step

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony</span>, <i>solus</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Father-in-law has been calling
me whelp, and hound, this half
year. Now if I pleased, I could be so
revenged upon the old grumbletonian.
But then I'm afraid—afraid of what?
I shall soon be worth fifteen hundred
a-year, and let him frighten me out of
<i>that</i> if he can.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Landlord</span>, <i>conducting</i> <span class='sc'>Marlow</span> <i>and</i>
<span class='sc'>Hastings</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> What a tedious uncomfortable
<a id='Page_395'></a>day have we had of it! We were
told it was but forty miles across the
country, and we have come above
threescore.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> And all, Marlow, from that
unaccountable reserve of yours, that
would not let us inquire more frequently
on the way.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I own, Hastings, I am unwilling
to lay myself under an obligation
to every one I meet; and often
stand the chance of an unmannerly
answer.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> At present, however, we are
not likely to receive any answer.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> No offence, gentlemen; but
I'm told you have been inquiring for
one Mr. Hardcastle, in those parts.
Do you know what part of the country
you are in?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Not in the least, sir; but
should thank you for information.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Nor the way you came?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> No, sir; but if you can
inform us——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Why, gentlemen, if you
know neither the road you are going,
nor where you are, nor the road you
came, the first thing I have to inform
you is, that—you have lost your way.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> We wanted no ghost to tell
us that.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Pray, gentlemen, may I be
so bold as to ask the place from
whence you came?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> That's not necessary towards
directing us where we are to go.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> No offence; but question for
question is all fair, you know. Pray,
gentlemen, is not this same Hardcastle
a cross-grained, old-fashioned,
whimsical fellow, with an ugly face; a
daughter, and a pretty son?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> We have not seen the gentleman;
but he has the family you mention.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_396'></a><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> The daughter, a tall trapesing,
trolloping, talkative May-pole——The
son, a pretty, well-bred, agreeable
youth, that everybody is fond of.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Our information differs in
this. The daughter is said to be
well-bred and beautiful; the son, an
awkward booby, reared up, and spoiled
at his mother's apron-string.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> He-he-hem—Then, gentlemen,
all I have to tell you is, that you
won't reach Mr. Hardcastle's house
this night, I believe.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Unfortunate!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> It's a damn'd long, dark,
boggy, dirty, dangerous way. Stingo,
tell the gentlemen the way to Mr.
Hardcastle's; (<i>winking upon the landlord.</i>)
Mr. Hardcastle's, of Quagmire
Marsh; you understand me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Land.</span> Master Hardcastle's? Lack-a-daisy,
my masters, you're come a
deadly deal wrong! When you came
to the bottom of the hill, you should
have crossed down Squash-lane.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Cross down Squash-lane?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Land.</span> Then you were to keep
straight forward, till you came to four
roads.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Come to where four roads
meet!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Aye; but you must be sure
to take only one of them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> O sir, you're facetious.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Then keeping to the right,
you are to go sideways till you come
upon Crack-skull-common: there you
must look sharp for the track of the
wheel, and go forward, till you come
to farmer Murrain's barn. Coming to
the farmer's barn, you are to turn to
the right, and then to the left, and
then to the right-about again, till you
find out the old mill——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Zounds, man! we could as
soon find out the longitude!</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_397'></a><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> What's to be done, Marlow?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> This house promises but a
poor reception; though perhaps the
landlord can accommodate us.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Land.</span> Alack, master, we have but
one spare bed in the whole house.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> And, to my knowledge, that's
taken up by three lodgers already.
(<i>After a pause, in which the rest seem
disconcerted.</i>) I have hit it. Don't
you think, Stingo, our landlady would
accommodate the gentlemen by the
fireside, with—three chairs and a
bolster?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> I hate sleeping by the fireside.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> And I detest your three
chairs and a bolster.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> You do, do you?—then let
me see—what if you go on a mile further,
to the Buck's Head; the old
Buck's Head on the hill, one of the
best inns in the whole country?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> O, ho! so we have escaped
an adventure for this night, however.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Land.</span> (<i>Apart to</i> <span class='sc'>Tony</span>.) Sure, you
ben't sending them to your father's as
an inn, be you?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Mum, you fool you. Let
<i>them</i> find that out. (<i>To them.</i>) You
have only to keep on straight forward,
till you come to a large old house by
the road-side. You'll see a pair of
large horns over the door. That's the
sign. Drive up the yard, and call
stoutly about you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Sir, we are obliged to you.
The servants can't miss the way.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> No, no. But I tell you
though, the landlord is rich, and going
to leave off business; so he wants to
be thought a gentleman, saving your
presence, he! he! he! He'll be for
giving you his company, and ecod, if
you mind him, he'll persuade you that
<a id='Page_398'></a>his mother was an alderman, and his
aunt a justice of the peace.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Land.</span> A troublesome old blade,
to be sure; but a keeps as good
wines and beds as any in the whole
country.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Well, if he supplies us with
these, we shall want no further connexion.
We are to turn to the right,
did you say?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> No, no; straightforward. I'll
just step myself, and show you a piece
of the way. (<i>To the landlord.</i>) Mum.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Land.</span> Ah, bless your heart, for a

four awkward Servants</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Well, I hope you're perfect
in the table exercise I have been
teaching you these three days. You
all know your posts and your places;
and can show that you have been used
to good company, without stirring from
home.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Omnes.</span> Ay, ay.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> When company comes, you
are not to pop out and stare, and then
run in again, like frighted rabbits in a
warren.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Omnes.</span> No, no.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> You, Diggory, whom I have
taken from the barn, are to make a
show at the side-table; and you,
Roger, whom I have advanced from
the plough, are to place yourself behind
<i>my</i> chair. But you're not to
stand so, with your hands in your
pockets. Take your hands from your
pockets, Roger; and from your head,
you blockhead you. See how Diggory
carries his hands. They're a little
too stiff, indeed, but that's no great
matter.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Digg.</span> Ay; mind how I hold them.
I learned to hold my hands this way,
when I was upon drill for the militia.
And so being upon drill—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> You must not be so talkative,
Diggory. You must be all attention
to the guests. You must hear us talk,
and not think of talking; you must
see us drink, and not think of drinking;
you must see us eat, and not
think of eating.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Digg.</span> By the laws, your worship,
that's parfectly unpossible. Whenever
Diggory sees yeating going forward,
ecod he's always wishing for a
mouthful himself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Blockhead! Is not a belly-full
in the kitchen as good as a belly-full
in the parlour? Stay your stomach
with that reflection.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Digg.</span> Ecod, I thank your worship
I'll make a shift to stay my stomach
with a slice of cold beef in the pantry.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Diggory you are too talkative.
Then if I happen to say a good
thing, or tell a good story at table, you
must not all burst out a-laughing, as
if you made part of the company.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_400'></a><span class='sc'>Digg.</span> Then ecod, your worship
must not tell the story of Ould Grouse
in the gun-room: I can't help laughing
at that—he! he! he!—for the
soul of me. We have laughed at that
these twenty years—ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Ha! ha! ha! The story is
a good one. Well, honest Diggory,
you may laugh at that—but still remember
to be attentive. Suppose one
of the company should call for a glass
of wine, how will you behave? A glass
of wine, sir, if you please. (<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Diggory</span>.)
Eh, why don't you move?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Digg.</span> Ecod, your worship, I never
have courage till I see the eatables and
drinkables brought upon the table, and
then I'm as bauld as a lion.</p>

good fire. Upon my word, a very
well-looking house; antique, but creditable.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> The usual fate of a large
mansion. Having first ruined the
master by good housekeeping, it at
last comes to levy contributions as an
inn.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> As you say, we passengers
are to be taxed to pay all these fineries.
I have often seen a good sideboard, or
a marble chimney-piece, though not
actually put in the bill, inflame the
bill confoundedly.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Travellers, George, must pay
in all places. The only difference is,
that in good inns you pay dearly for
luxuries; in bad inns you are fleeced
and starved.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> You have lived pretty much
among them. In truth, I have been
often surprised, that you, who have
seen so much of the world, with your
natural good sense, and your many
opportunities, could never yet acquire
a requisite share of assurance.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> The Englishman's malady.
But tell me, George, where could I
have learned that assurance you talk
<a id='Page_402'></a>of? My life has been chiefly spent in
a college, or an inn; in seclusion from
that lovely part of the creation that
chiefly teach men confidence. I don't
know that I was ever familiarly acquainted
with a single modest woman—except
my mother—But among
females of another class, you know—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Aye, among them you are
impudent enough of all conscience.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> They are of <i>us</i>, you know.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> But in the company of women
of reputation, I never saw such an
idiot, such a trembler; you look, for
all the world, as if you wanted an
opportunity of stealing out of the
room.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Why, man, that's because I
<i>do</i> want to steal out of the room.
Faith, I have often formed a resolution
to break the ice, and rattle away
at any rate. But I don't know how, a
single glance from a pair of fine eyes
has totally overset my resolution. An
impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty;
but I'll be hanged if a modest
man can ever counterfeit impudence.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> If you could but say half the
fine things to them that I have heard
you lavish upon the bar-maid of an inn,
or even a college bed-maker—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Why, George, I can't say
fine things to them. They freeze,
they petrify me. They may talk of a
comet, or a burning mountain, or some
such bagatelle: but to me, a modest
woman, dressed out in all her finery,
is the most tremendous object of the
whole creation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Ha! ha! ha! At this rate,
man, how can you ever expect to
marry?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Never, unless, as among
kings and princes, my bride were to
be courted by proxy. If, indeed, like
an eastern bridegroom, one were to be
<a id='Page_403'></a>introduced to a wife he never saw
before, it might be endured. But to
go through all the terrors of a formal
courtship, together with the episode of
aunts, grandmothers, and cousins, and
at last to blurt out the broad-star question,
of—<i>madam, will you marry me?</i>
No, no; that's a strain much above
me, I assure you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> I pity you. But how do you
intend behaving to the lady you are
come down to visit at the request of
your father?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> As I behave to all other
ladies: bow very low; answer yes, or
no, to all her demands—But for the
rest, I don' think I shall venture to
look in her face till I see my father's
again.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> I am surprised that one who
is so warm a friend can be so cool a
lover.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> To be explicit, my dear
Hastings, my chief inducement down,
was to be instrumental in forwarding
your happiness, not my own. Miss
Neville loves you, the family don't
know you, as my friend you are a sure
of a reception, and let honour do the
rest.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> My dear Marlow!—But I'll
suppress the emotion. Were I a
wretch, meanly seeking to carry off a
fortune, you should be the last man in
the world I would apply to for assistance.
But Miss Neville's person is all
I ask; and that is mine, both from her
deceased father's consent, and her own
inclination.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Happy man! You have
talents and art to captivate any woman.
I am doomed to adore the sex, and yet
to converse with the only part of it I
despise. This stammer in my address,
and this awkward prepossessing visage
of mine, can never permit me to soar
<a id='Page_404'></a>above the reach of a milliner's prentice,
or one of the duchesses of Drury-lane.—Pshaw!
this fellow here to
interrupt us.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Hardcastle</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Gentlemen, once more you
are heartily welcome. Which is Mr.
Marlow? Sir, you are heartily welcome.
It's not my way, you see, to receive my
friends with my back to the fire. I
like to give them a hearty reception, in
the old style, at my gate. I like to
see their horses and trunks taken
care of.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) He has got our
names from the servants already. (<i>To
him.</i>) We approve your caution and
hospitality, sir. (<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Hastings</span>.) I have
been thinking, George, of changing
our travelling dresses in the morning.
I am grown confoundedly ashamed of
mine.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I beg, Mr. Marlow, you'll
use no ceremony in this house.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> I fancy, Charles, you're
right: the first blow is half the battle.
I intend opening the campaign with
the white and gold.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Mr. Marlow—Mr. Hastings—gentlemen—pray
be under no restraint
in this house. This is Liberty
Hall, gentlemen. You may do just
as you please here.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Yet, George, if we open
the campaign too fiercely at first we
may want ammunition before it is over.
I think to reserve the embroidery to
secure a retreat.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Your talking of a retreat,
Mr. Marlow, puts me in mind of the
Duke of Marlborough, when he went
to besiege Denain. He first summoned
the garrison.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Don't you think the <i>ventre</i>
<a id='Page_405'></a><i>d'or</i> waistcoat will do with the plain brown?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> He first summoned the
garrison, which might consist of about
five thousand men—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> I think not: brown and
yellow mix but very poorly.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I say, gentlemen, as I was
telling you, he summoned the garrison,
which might consist of about five
thousand men—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> The girls like finery.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Which might consist of
about five thousand men, well appointed
with stores, ammunition, and
other implements of war. Now, says
the Duke of Marlborough, to George
Brooks, that stood next to him—you
must have heard of George Brooks;
"I'll pawn my dukedom," says he,
"but I take that garrison without
spilling a drop of blood." So——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> What, my good friend, if
you gave us a glass of punch in the
meantime? It would help us to carry
on the siege with vigour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Punch, sir! (<i>Aside.</i>) This
is the most unaccountable kind of modesty
I ever met with.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Yes, sir, punch. A glass of
warm punch, after our journey, will
be comfortable. This is Liberty-hall,
you know.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Here's cup, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) So this fellow, in
his Liberty-hall, will only let us have
just what he pleases.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> (<i>Taking the cup.</i>) I hope
you'll find it to your mind. I have
prepared it with my own hands, and
I believe you'll own the ingredients
are tolerable. Will you be so good as
to pledge me, sir? Here, Mr. Marlow,
here is to our better acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Drinks.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) A very impudent
<a id='Page_406'></a>fellow this! but he's a character, and
I'll humour him a little. Sir, my service
to you.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Drinks.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) I see this fellow
wants to give us his company, and
forgets that he's an inn-keeper, before
he has learned to be a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> From the excellence of your
cup my old friend, I suppose you have
a good deal of business in this part of
the country. Warm work, now and
then, at elections, I suppose.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> No, sir, I have long given
that work over. Since our betters
have hit upon the expedient of electing
each other, there's no business <i>for us
that sell ale</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> So, then you have no turn
for politics I see.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Not in the least. There
was a time, indeed, I fretted myself
about the mistakes of government, like
other people; but, finding myself every
day grow more angry, and the government
growing no better, I left it to
mend itself. Since that, I no more
trouble my head about <i>Heyder Alley</i>,
or <i>Ally Cawn</i>, than about <i>Ally Croaker</i>.—Sir,
my service to you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> So that with eating above
stairs, and drinking below; with receiving
your friends within, and amusing
them without, you lead a good
pleasant bustling life of it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I do stir about a great deal,
that's certain. Half the differences of
the parish are adjusted in this very
parlour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>After drinking.</i>) And you
have an argument in your cup, old
gentleman, better than any in Westminster
Hall.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Ay, young gentleman, that,
and a little philosophy.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Well, this is the
<a id='Page_407'></a>first time I ever heard of an inn-keeper's
philosophy!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> So then, like an experienced
general, you attack them on every
quarter. If you find their reason
manageable, you attack it with your
philosophy; if you find they have no
reason, you attack them with this.—Here's
your health, my philosopher.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Drinks.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Good, very good, thank you;
ha! ha! Your generalship puts me
in mind of Prince Eugene, when he
fought the Turks at the battle of Belgrade.
You shall hear.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Instead of the battle of Belgrade,
I think it's almost time to talk
about supper. What has your philosophy
got in the house for supper?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> For supper, sir! (<i>Aside.</i>)
Was ever such a request to a man in
his own house?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Yes, sir; supper, sir: I begin
to feel an appetite. I shall make devilish
work to-night in the larder, I promise
you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Such a brazen dog
sure never my eyes beheld. (<i>To him.</i>)
Why really, sir, as for supper, I can't
well tell. My Dorothy, and the cook-maid,
settle these things between them.
I leave these kind of things entirely to
them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> You do, do you?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Entirely. By-the-by, I believe
they are in actual consultation,
upon what's for supper, this moment
in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Then I beg they'll admit
<i>me</i> as one of their privy council. It's
a way I have got. When I travel, I
always choose to regulate my own
supper. Let the cook be called. No
offence I hope, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> O no, sir, none in the least;
yet, I don't know how, our Bridget,
<a id='Page_408'></a>the cook-maid, is not very communicative
upon these occasions. Should
we send for her, she might scold us
all out of the house.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Let's see the list of the
larder then. I ask it as a favour. I
always match my appetite to my bill
of fare.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Hardcastle</span>, <i>who looks
at them with surprise</i>.) Sir, he's very
right, and it's my way too.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Sir, you have a right to command
here. Roger, bring us the bill
of fare for to-night's supper. I believe
it's drawn up. Your manner, Mr.
Hastings, puts me in mind of my
uncle, Colonel Wallop. It was a saying
of his that no man was sure of his
supper till he had eaten it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) All upon the high
ropes! His uncle a colonel! we shall
soon hear of his mother being a justice
of peace. But let's hear the bill of
fare.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Perusing.</i>) What's here?
For the first course; for the second
course; for the dessert. The devil,
sir, do you think we have brought
down the whole joiner's company, or
the corporation of Bedford, to eat up
such a supper? Two or three little
things, clean and comfortable, will do.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> But let's hear it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Reading.</i>) For the first
course at the top, a pig, and pruin
sauce.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Damn your pig, I say.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> And damn your pruin sauce,
say I.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> And yet, gentlemen, to men
that are hungry, pig, with pruin sauce,
is very good eating.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> At the bottom, a calf's tongue
and brains.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Let your brains be knocked
out, my good sir; I don't like them.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_409'></a><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Or you may clap them on a
plate by themselves. I do.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Their impudence
confounds me. (<i>To them.</i>) Gentlemen,
you are my guests, make what alterations
you please. Is there any thing
else you wish to retrench, or alter, gentlemen?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Item, A pork pie, a boiled
rabbit and sausages, a florentine, a
shaking pudding, and a dish of tiff—taff—taffety
cream!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Confound your made dishes.
I shall be as much at a loss in this
house, as at a green and yellow dinner,
at the French ambassador's table. I'm
for plain eating.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I'm sorry, gentlemen, that
I have nothing you like; but if there

fancy to——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Why really, sir, your bill of
fare is so exquisite, that any one part
of it is full as good as another. Send
us what you please. So much for
supper: and now to see that our beds
are aired, and properly taken care of.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I entreat you'll leave all
that to me. You shall not stir a
step.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Leave that to you? I protest,
sir, you must excuse me; I always
look to these things myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I must insist, sir, you'll
make yourself easy on that head.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> You see I'm resolved on it.
<a id='Page_410'></a>(<i>Aside.</i>) A very troublesome fellow
this, as ever I met with.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Well, sir, I'm resolved at
least to attend you. (<i>Aside.</i>) This may
be modern modesty, but I never saw
anything look so like old-fashioned
impudence.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hastings</span>, <i>solus</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> So I find, this fellow's civilities
begin to grow troublesome. But
who can be angry at those assiduities,
which are meant to please him? Ha!
what do I see? Miss Neville, by all
that's happy!</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Neville</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> My dear Hastings! To
what unexpected good fortune, to what
accident am I to ascribe this happy
meeting?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Rather, let me ask the same
question, as I could never have hoped
to meet my dear Constance at an inn.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> An inn? sure you mistake!
my aunt, my guardian, lives
here. What could induce you to think
this house an inn?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> My friend, Mr. Marlow, with
whom I came down, and I, have been
sent here as to an inn, I assure you.
A young fellow, whom we accidentally
met at a house hard by, directed us
hither.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Certainly it must be one
of my hopeful cousin's tricks, of whom
you have heard me talk so often, ha!
ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> He whom your aunt intends
for you? He of whom I have such
just apprehensions?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> You have nothing to fear from him,
I assure you. You'd adore him, if you knew how
heartily he despises me. My aunt knows it too,
<a id='Page_411'></a>and has undertaken to court me for him;
and actually begins to think she has
made a conquest.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Thou dear dissembler! You
must know, my Constance, I have just
seized this happy opportunity of my
friend's visit here, to get admittance
into the family. The horses that
carried us down, are now fatigued
with their journey; but they'll soon
be refreshed; and then, if my dearest
girl will trust in her faithful Hastings,
we shall soon be landed in France;
where, even among slaves, the laws of
marriage are respected.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> I have often told you
that, though ready to obey you, I yet
should leave my little fortune behind
with reluctance. The greatest part of
it was left me by my uncle, the India
director, and chiefly consists in jewels.
I have been for some time persuading
my aunt to let me wear them. I fancy
I am very near succeeding. The instant
they are put into my possession,
you shall find me ready to make them
and myself yours.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Perish the baubles! Your
person is all I desire. In the meantime,
my friend Marlow must not
be let into his mistake; I know the
strange reserve of his temper is such,
that if abruptly informed of it, he
would instantly quit the house, before
our plan was ripe for execution.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> But how shall we keep
him in the deception? Miss Hardcastle
is just returned from walking;
what if we still continue to deceive
him?—This, this way——</p>

<p class='c016'><i>They confer.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Marlow</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> The assiduities of these good
people tease me beyond bearing. My
host seems to think it ill manners to
<a id='Page_412'></a>leave me alone, and so he claps not
only himself, but his old-fashioned wife
on my back. They talk of coming to
sup with us too; and then, I suppose,
we are to run the gauntlet through all
the rest of the family.—What have we
got here?—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> My dear Charles! Let me
congratulate you!—The most fortunate
accident!—Who do you think is just
alighted?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Cannot guess.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Our mistresses, boy, Miss
Hardcastle and Miss Neville. Give
me leave to introduce Miss Constance
Neville to your acquaintance. Happening
to dine in the neighbourhood,
they called, on their return, to take
fresh horses here. Miss Hardcastle
has just stept into the next room, and
will be back in an instant. Wasn't it
lucky, eh?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) I have just been
mortified enough of all conscience, and
here comes something to complete my
embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Well, but wasn't it the most
fortunate thing in the world?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Oh! yes. Very fortunate—a
most joyful encounter—But our
dresses, George, you know, are in disorder—What
if we should postpone
the happiness till to-morrow?—To-morrow,
at her own house—It will be
every bit as convenient—And rather
more respectful—To-morrow let it be.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Offering to go.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> By no means, sir. Your
ceremony will displease her. The disorder
of your dress will show the
ardour of your impatience: besides,
she knows you are in the house, and
will permit you to see her.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> O! the devil! how shall I
support it? Hem! hem! Hastings,
you must not go. You are to assist
<a id='Page_413'></a>me, you know. I shall be confoundedly
ridiculous. Yet, hang it! I'll take
courage. Hem!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Pshaw, man! it's but the
first plunge, and all's over. She's but
a woman, you know.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> And of all women, she that
I dread most to encounter.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Hardcastle</span>, <i>as returning from
walking, a bonnet, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> (<i>Introducing him.</i>) Miss
Hardcastle—Mr. Marlow. I'm proud
of bringing two persons of such merit
together, that only want to know, to
esteem each other.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Now, for meeting
my modest gentleman with a demure
face, and quite in his own manner.
(<i>After a pause, in which he appears
very uneasy and disconcerted.</i>) I'm glad
of your safe arrival, sir—I'm told, you
had some accidents by the way.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Only a few, madam. Yes,
we had some. Yes, madam, a good
many accidents; but should be sorry—madam—or
rather glad of any accidents—that
are so agreeably concluded.
Hem!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> (<i>To him.</i>) You never spoke
better in your whole life. Keep it up,
and I'll ensure you the victory.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I'm afraid you flatter,
sir. You, that have seen so much of
the finest company, can find little
entertainment in an obscure corner of
the country.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Gathering courage.</i>) I have
lived, indeed, in the world, madam;
but I have kept very little company.
I have been but an observer upon life,
madam, while others were enjoying it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> But that, I am told, is
the way to enjoy it at last.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> (<i>To him.</i>) Cicero never spoke
<a id='Page_414'></a>better. Once more, and you are confirmed
in assurance for ever.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>To him.</i>) Hem! Stand
by me, then, and when I'm down,
throw in a word or two, to set me
up again.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> An observer, like you,
upon life, were, I fear, disagreeably
employed, since you must have had
much more to censure than to approve.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Pardon me, madam. I was
always willing to be amused. The
folly of most people is rather an object
of mirth than uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> (<i>To him.</i>) Bravo, bravo.
Never spoke so well in your whole
life. Well! Miss Hardcastle, I see,
that you and Mr. Marlow are going
to be very good company. I believe
our being here will but embarrass the
interview.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Not in the least, Mr. Hastings.
We like your company of all
things. (<i>To him.</i>) Zounds! George,
sure you won't go: how can you
leave us?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Our presence will but spoil
conversation, so we'll retire to the
next room. (<i>To him.</i>) You don't
consider, man, that we are to manage
a little tête-à-tête of our own.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> (<i>After a pause.</i>) But
you have not been wholly an observer,
I presume, sir: the ladies, I should
hope, have employed some part of
your addresses.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Relapsing into timidity.</i>)
Pardon me, madam, I—I—I—as yet
have studied—only—to—deserve
them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> And that, some say, is
the very worst way to obtain them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Perhaps so, madam. But
I love to converse only with the more
<a id='Page_415'></a>grave and sensible part of the sex.—But
I'm afraid I grow tiresome.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Not at all, sir; there
is nothing I like so much as grave
conversation myself; I could hear it
for ever. Indeed—I have often been
surprised how a man of <i>sentiment</i>
could ever admire those light airy
pleasures, where nothing reaches the
heart.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> It's—a disease—of the
mind, madam. In the variety of
tastes there must be some who, wanting
a relish—for—um-a-um.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I understand you, sir.
There must be some, who, wanting a
relish for refined pleasures, pretend to
despise what they are incapable of
tasting.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> My meaning, madam, but
infinitely better expressed. And I
can't help observing—a—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Who could
ever suppose this fellow impudent
upon some occasions? (<i>To him.</i>) You
were going to observe, sir——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I was observing, madam—I
protest, madam, I forget what I was
going to observe.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) I vow, and
so do I. (<i>To him.</i>) You were
observing, sir, that in this age of
hypocrisy, something about hypocrisy,
sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Yes, madam; in this age
of hypocrisy there are few who, upon
strict inquiry, do not—a—a—a—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I understand you perfectly,
sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Egad! and that's
more than I do myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> You mean that, in this
hypocritical age, there are few that
do not condemn in public what they
practise in private, and think they
<a id='Page_416'></a>pay every debt to virtue when they
praise it.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> True, madam; those who
have most virtue in their mouths,
have least of it in their bosoms. But
I'm sure I tire you, madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Not in the least, sir;
there's something so agreeable, and
<a id='Page_417'></a>spirited, in your manner; such life
and force—pray, sir, go on.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Yes, madam; I was saying—that
there are some occasions—when
a total want of courage, madam,
destroys all the—and puts us—upon
a—a—a—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I agree with you
entirely; a want of courage upon
some occasions, assumes the appearance
of ignorance, and betrays us
when we most want to excel. I beg
you'll proceed.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Yes, madam; morally speaking,
madam—But I see Miss Neville,
expecting us in the next room. I
would not intrude for the world.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I protest, sir, I never
was more agreeably entertained in all
my life. Pray go on.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Yes, madam; I was—But
she beckons us to join her. Madam,
shall I do myself the honour to attend
you?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Well then, I'll follow.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) This pretty smooth
dialogue has done for me.</p>

Yet the fellow, but for his unaccountable
bashfulness, is pretty well too.
He has good sense; but then, so
buried in his fears, that it fatigues
one more than ignorance. If I could
teach him a little confidence, it would
be doing somebody, that I know of,
a piece of service. But who is that

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> I hope, cousin, one may

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Ay, but I know what sort
of a relation you want to make me
though; but it won't do. I tell you,
cousin Con, it won't do, so I beg
you'll keep your distance; I want
no nearer relationship.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>She follows, coquetting him to the back-scene.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Well! I vow, Mr.
Hastings, you are very entertaining.
There's nothing in the world I love
to talk of so much as London, and
the fashions, though I was never there
myself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Never there! You amaze
me! From your air and manner, I
concluded you had been bred all your
life either at Ranelagh, St. James's, or
Tower Wharf.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> O! sir, you're only
pleased to say so. We country persons
can have no manner at all. I'm
in love with the town, and that serves
to raise me above some of our neighbouring
rustics; but who can have
a manner, that has never seen the
Pantheon, the Grotto Gardens, the
Borough, and such places, where the
nobility chiefly resort? All I can do,
is to enjoy London at second-hand.
I take care to know every tête-à-tête
from the Scandalous Magazine, and
have all the fashions, as they come
out, in a letter from the two Miss
Rickets of Crooked-lane. Pray how
do you like this head, Mr. Hastings?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Extremely elegant and <i>dégagée</i>,
upon my word, madam. Your
friseur is a Frenchman, I suppose?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> I protest I dressed it
myself from a print in the Ladies'
Memorandum Book for the last year.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_419'></a><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Indeed! such a head in a
side-box, at the play-house, would
draw as many gazers, as my lady
Mayoress at a city ball.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> I vow, since inoculation
began, there is no such thing to
be seen as a plain woman; so one
must dress a little particular, or one
may escape in the crowd.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> But that can never be your
case, madam, in any dress.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Yet what signifies <i>my</i>
dressing when I have such a piece of
antiquity by my side as Mr. Hardcastle?
all I can say will not argue
down a single button from his clothes.
I have often wanted him to throw off
his great flaxen wig, and where he
was bald, to plaster it over, like my
lord Pately, with powder.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> You are right, madam; for
as, among the ladies, there are none
ugly, so, among the men, there are
none old.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_420'></a><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> But what do you
think his answer was? Why, with
his usual gothic vivacity, he said, I
only wanted him to throw off his wig,
to convert it into a tête for my own
wearing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Intolerable! At your age
you may wear what you please, and
it must become you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Pray, Mr. Hastings,
what do you take to be the most
fashionable age about town?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Some time ago, forty was all
the mode; but I'm told the ladies
intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing
winter.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Seriously! then I shall
be too young for the fashion.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> No lady begins now to put
on jewels till she's past forty. For
instance, Miss there, in a polite circle,
would be considered as a child, as a
mere maker of samplers.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> And yet Mrs. Niece
thinks herself as much a woman, and
is as fond of jewels, as the oldest of
us all.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Your niece, is she? and that
young gentleman, a brother of yours,
I should presume?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> My son, sir. They
are contracted to each other. Observe
their little sports. They fall in and
out ten times a day, as if they were
man and wife already. (<i>To them.</i>)
Well, Tony, child, what soft things
are you saying to your cousin Constance
this evening.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> I have been saying no soft
things; but that it's very hard to be
followed about so. Ecod! I've not a
place in the house now, that's left to
myself, but the stable.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Never mind him, Con
my dear. He's in another story behind
your back.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_421'></a><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> There's something generous
in my cousin's manner. He
falls out before faces to be forgiven
in private.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> That's a damned confounded—crack.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Ah! he's a sly one.
Don't you think they're like each
other about the mouth, Mr. Hastings?
The Blenkinsop mouth to a
T. They're of a size too. Back to
back, my pretties, that Mr. Hastings
may see you. Come, Tony.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> You had as good not make
me, I tell you.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Measuring.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> O lud! he has almost
cracked my head.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> O, the monster! For
shame, Tony. You a man, and behave
so!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> If I'm a man, let me have
my fortin. Ecod, I'll not be made a
fool of no longer.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Is this, ungrateful
boy, all that I'm to get for the pains
I have taken in your education? I
that have rocked you in your cradle,
and fed that pretty mouth with a
spoon! Did not I work that waistcoat,
to make you genteel? Did
not I prescribe for you every day,
and weep while the receipt was operating?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Ecod! you had reason to
weep, for you have been dosing me
ever since I was born. I have gone
through every receipt in the Complete
Huswife ten times over; and
you have thoughts of coursing me
through <i>Quincy</i> next spring. But,
ecod! I tell you, I'll not be made a
fool of no longer.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Wasn't it all for your
good, viper? Wasn't it all for your
good?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> I wish you'd let me and my
<a id='Page_422'></a>good alone then. Snubbing this way,
when I'm in spirits. If I'm to have
any good, let it come of itself; not
to keep dinging it, dinging it into
one so.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> That's false; I never
see you when you're in spirits. No,
Tony, you then go to the alehouse, or
kennel. I'm never to be delighted
with your agreeable wild notes, unfeeling
monster!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Ecod! mamma, your own
notes are the wildest of the two.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Was ever the like!
But I see he wants to break my heart,
I see he does.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Dear madam, permit me to
lecture the young gentleman a little.
I'm certain I can persuade him to his
duty.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Well! I must retire.
Come, Constance, my love. You see,
Mr. Hastings, the wretchedness of my
situation. Was ever poor woman so

provoking, undutiful boy?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> To me she appears sensible

<p class='c017'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Hardcastle</span>, <i>solus</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> What could my old friend
Sir Charles mean, by recommending
his son as the modestest young man in
town? To me he appears the most
impudent piece of brass that ever
spoke with a tongue. He has taken
possession of the easy chair by the
fireside already. He took off his
boots in the parlour, and desired me
to see them taken care of. I'm desirous
to know how his impudence
affects my daughter.—She will certainly
be shocked at it.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Hardcastle</span>, <i>plainly dressed</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Well, my Kate, I see you
have changed your dress, as I bid you;
and yet, I believe, there was no great
occasion.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I find such a pleasure,
sir, in obeying your commands, that I
take care to obey them without ever
debating their propriety.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> And yet, Kate, I sometimes
give you some cause, particularly when
I recommended my <i>modest</i> gentleman
to you as a lover to-day.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> You taught me to
expect something extraordinary, and I
find the original exceeds the description.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I was never so surprised in
my life! He has quite confounded all
my faculties!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I never saw anything
like it: and a man of the world too!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Ay, he learned it all abroad,—what
a fool was I, to think a young
man could learn modesty by travelling!
He might as soon learn wit at a
masquerade.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> It seems all natural to
him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> A good deal assisted by
bad company, and a French dancing-master.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Sure you mistake,
papa! A French dancing-master
could never have taught him that
timid look,—that awkward address,—that
bashful manner—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Whose look? whose manner,
child?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Mr. Marlow's: his
<a id='Page_426'></a>mauvaise honte, his timidity struck me
at the first sight.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Then your first sight deceived
you; for I think him one of the
most brazen first-sights that ever
astonished my senses.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Sure, sir, you rally! I
never saw any one so modest.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> And can you be serious! I

puppy, since I was born. Bully
Dawson was but a fool to him.</p>

tired me with apologies for being tiresome;
then left the room with a bow,
<a id='Page_427'></a>and, "Madam, I would not for the
world detain you."</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> He spoke to me, as if he
knew me all his life before; asked
twenty questions, and never waited for
an answer; interrupted my best remarks
with some silly pun; and when
I was in my best story of the Duke of
Marlborough and Prince Eugene, he
asked if I had not a good hand at
making punch. Yes, Kate, he asked
your father if he was a maker of
punch!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> One of us must certainly
be mistaken.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> If he be what he has shown
himself, I'm determined he shall never
have my consent.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> And if he be the
sullen thing I take him, he shall never
have mine.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> In one thing then we are
agreed—to reject him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Yes. But upon conditions.
For if you should find him
less impudent, and I more presuming;
if you find him more respectful, and I
more importunate—I don't know—the
fellow is good enough for a man—Certainly
we don't meet many such at
a horse-race in the country.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> If we should find him so—but
that's impossible. The first appearance
has done my business. I'm
seldom deceived in that.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> And yet there may be
many good qualities under that first
appearance.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Ay, when a girl finds a
fellow's outside to her taste, she then
sets about guessing the rest of his
furniture. With her, a smooth face
stands for good sense, and a genteel
figure, for every virtue.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I hope, sir, a conversation
begun with a compliment to my
<a id='Page_428'></a>good sense, won't end with a sneer at
my understanding.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Pardon me, Kate. But if
young Mr. Brazen can find the art of
reconciling contradictions, he may
please us both, perhaps.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> And as one of us
must be mistaken, what if we go to
make further discoveries?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> But depend on't I'm in the
right.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> And depend on't I'm
not much in the wrong.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Tony</span> <i>running in with a casket</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Ecod! I have got them.
Here they are. My cousin Con's
necklaces, bobs, and all. My mother
shan't cheat the poor souls out of
their fortin neither. O! my genius,
is that you?</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Hastings</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> My dear friend, how have
you managed with your mother? I
hope you have amused her with pretending
love for your cousin; and
that you are willing to be reconciled
at last. Our horses will be refreshed
in a short time, and we shall soon be
ready to set off.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> And here's something to
bear your charges by the way. (<i>Giving
the casket.</i>) Your sweetheart's
jewels. Keep them; and hang those,
I say, that would rob you of one of
them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> But how have you procured
them from your mother?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Ask me no questions, and
I'll tell you no fibs. I procured
them by the rule of thumb. If I had
not a key to every drawer in mother's
bureau, how could I go to the alehouse
so often as I do? An honest man
<a id='Page_429'></a>may rob of himself his own at any
time.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Thousands do it every day.
But to be plain with you; Miss
Neville is endeavouring to procure
them from her aunt this very instant.
If she succeeds, it will be the most
delicate way at least of obtaining
them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Well, keep them, till you
know how it will be. I know how it
will be well enough; she'd as soon
part with the only sound tooth in her
head.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> But I dread the effects of
her resentment, when she finds she
has lost them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Never you mind her resentment,
leave <i>me</i> to manage that. I
don't value her resentment the bounce
of a cracker. Zounds! here they are.
Morrice. Prance.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony</span>, <span class='sc'>Mrs. Hardcastle</span>, <span class='sc'>Miss Neville</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Indeed, Constance,
you amaze me. Such a girl as you
want jewels! It will be time enough
for jewels, my dear, twenty years
hence; when your beauty begins to
want repairs.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> But what will repair
beauty at forty, will certainly improve
it at twenty, madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Yours, my dear, can
admit of none. That natural blush is
beyond a thousand ornaments. Besides,
child, jewels are quite out at
present. Don't you see half the
ladies of our acquaintance, my Lady
Kill-day-light, and Mr. Crump, and
the rest of them, carry their jewels to
town, and bring nothing but paste
and marcasites back?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> But who knows, madam,
but somebody that shall be nameless
<a id='Page_430'></a>would like me best with all my little
finery about me?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Consult your glass,
my dear, and then see, if, with such a
pair of eyes, you want any better
sparklers. What do you think, Tony,
my dear, does your cousin Con want
jewels, in your eyes to set off her
beauty?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> That's as thereafter may be.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> My dear aunt, if you
knew how it would oblige me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> A parcel of old
fashioned rose and table-cut things.
They would make you look like the
court of king Solomon at a puppet-show.
Besides, I believe I can't
readily come at them. They may be
missing for aught I know to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> (<i>Apart to</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Hardcastle</span>.)
Then why don't you tell her so at
once, as she's so longing for them?
Tell her they're lost. It's the only
way to quiet her. Say they're lost,
and call me to bear witness.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> (<i>Apart to</i> <span class='sc'>Tony</span>.) You
know, my dear, I'm only keeping
them for you. So, if I say they're
gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?
He! he! he!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Never fear me. Ecod! I'll
say I saw them taken out with mine
own eyes.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> I desire them but for a
day, madam. Just to be permitted
to show them as relics, and then they
may be locked up again.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> To be plain with you,
my dear Constance; if I could find
them, you should have them. They're
missing, I assure you. Lost, for
aught I know; but we must have
patience wherever they are.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> I'll not believe it; this
is but a shallow pretence to deny me.
<a id='Page_431'></a>I know they're too valuable to be so
slightly kept, and as you are to answer
for the loss.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Don't be alarmed,
Constance; if they be lost, I must
restore an equivalent. But my son
knows they are missing, and not to be
found.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> That I can bear witness to.
They are missing, and not to be found,
I'll take my oath on't.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> You must learn resignation,
my dear; for though we lose
our fortune, yet we should not lose
our patience. See me, how calm I
am.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Ay, people are generally
calm at the misfortunes of
others.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Now, I wonder a girl
of your good sense, should waste a
thought upon such trumpery. We
shall soon find them; and, in the
mean time, you shall make use of my
garnets, till your jewels be found.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> I detest garnets.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> The most becoming
things in the world to set off a clear
complexion. You have often seen how
well they look upon me. You <i>shall</i>
have them.</p>

    <div><i>Exit.</i></div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> I dislike them of all
things. You shan't stir.—Was ever
anything so provoking? to mislay my
own jewels, and force me to wear her
trumpery.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Don't be a fool. If she gives
you the garnets, take what you can get.
The jewels are your own already. I
have stolen them out of her bureau,
and she does not know it. Fly to your
spark, he'll tell you more of the matter.
Leave me to manage <i>her</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> My dear cousin!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Vanish. She's here, and has
missed them already. Zounds! how
<a id='Page_432'></a>she fidgets, and spits about like a
Catherine-wheel!</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Hardcastle</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Confusion! thieves!
robbers! We are cheated, plundered,
broke open, undone.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> What's the matter, what's
the matter, mamma? I hope nothing
has happened to any of the good
family!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> We are robbed. My
bureau has been broke open, the jewels
taken out, and I'm undone.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Oh! is that all? Ha! ha!
ha! By the laws, I never saw it better
acted in my life. Ecod, I thought
you was ruined in earnest; ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Why, boy, I <i>am</i> ruined
in earnest. My bureau has been broke
open, and all taken away.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Stick to that; ha, ha, ha!
stick to that; I'll bear witness, you
know; call me to bear witness.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> I tell you, Tony, by
all that's precious, the jewels are gone,
and I shall be ruined for ever.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Sure, I know they're gone,
and I am to say so.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> My dearest Tony, but
hear me. They're gone, I say.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> By the laws, mamma, you
make me for to laugh; ha! ha! I know
who took them well enough, ha! ha!
ha!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Was there ever such
a blockhead, that can't tell the difference
between jest and earnest? I tell
you I'm not in jest, booby.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> That's right, that's right.
You must be in a bitter passion, and
then nobody will suspect either of us.
I'll bear witness that they are gone.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Was there ever such a
cross-grained brute, that won't hear
me! Can you bear witness that you're
<a id='Page_433'></a>no better than a fool? Was ever poor
woman so beset with fools on one
hand, and thieves on the other?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> I can bear witness to that.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Bear witness again, you
blockhead you, and I'll turn you out
of the room directly. My poor niece,
what will become of <i>her</i>! Do you
laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you
enjoyed my distress?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> I can bear witness to that.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Do you insult me,
monster? I'll teach you to vex your
mother, I will.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> I can bear witness to that.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>He runs off, she follows him.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Hardcastle</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Maid</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> What an unaccountable
creature is that brother of mine, to
send them to the house as an inn, ha!
ha! I don't wonder at his impudence.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Maid.</span> But what is more, madam,
the young gentlemen, as you passed by
in your present dress, asked me if you
were the bar-maid? He mistook you
for the bar-maid, madam.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Did he? Then, as I
live, I'm resolved to keep up the delusion.
Tell me, Pimple, how do you
like my present dress? Don't you
think I look something like Cherry in
the Beaux' Stratagem?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Maid.</span> It's the dress, madam, that
every lady wears in the country, but
when she visits or receives company.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> And are you sure he
does not remember my face or person?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Maid.</span> Certain of it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I vow, I thought so;
for though we spoke for some time together,
yet his fears were such, that he
never once looked up during the interview.
Indeed, if he had, my bonnet
would have kept him from seeing me.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_434'></a><span class='sc'>Maid.</span> But what do you hope from
keeping him in his mistake?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> In the first place I
shall be <i>seen</i>, and that is no small advantage
to a girl who brings her face
to market. Then I shall, perhaps,
make an acquaintance, and that's no
small victory gained over one, who
never addresses any but the wildest of
her sex. But my chief aim is to take
my gentleman off his guard, and, like
an invisible champion of romance, examine
the giant's force before I offer
to combat.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Maid.</span> But are you sure you can
act your part, and disguise your voice,
so that he may mistake that, as he has
already mistaken your person?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Never fear me. I think
I have got the true bar-cant—Did your
honour call?—Attend the Lion there.—Pipes
and tobacco for the Angel.—The
Lamb has been outrageous this
half-hour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Maid.</span> It will do, madam. But he's
here.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Marlow</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> What a bawling in every
part of the house! I have scarce a
moment's repose. If I go to the best
room, there I find my host and his
story. If I fly to the gallery, there
we have my hostess, with her curtesy
down to the ground. I have at last
got a moment to myself, and now for
recollection.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Walks and muses.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Did you call, sir?
Did your honour call?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Musing</i>). As for Miss Hardcastle,
she's too grave and sentimental
for me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Did your honour call?</p>

<p class='c016'><i>She still places herself before him, he turning
away.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> No, child. (<i>Musing.</i>) Besides,
<a id='Page_435'></a>from the glimpse I had of her, I think
she squints.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I'm sure, sir, I heard
the bell ring.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> No, no. (<i>Musing.</i>) I have
pleased my father, however, by coming
down, and I'll to-morrow please myself
by returning.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Taking out his tablets, and perusing.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Perhaps the other gentleman
called, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I tell you, no.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I should be glad to
know, sir. We have such a parcel of
servants.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> No, no, I'll tell you. (<i>Looks
full in her face.</i>) Yes, child, I think I
did call. I wanted—I wanted—I vow,
child, you are vastly handsome.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> O la, sir, you'll make
one ashamed.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Never saw a more sprightly
malicious eye. Yes, yes, my dear, I
did call. Have you got any of your—a—what
d'ye call it, in the house?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> No, sir, we have been
out of that these ten days.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> One may call in this house,
I find, to very little purpose. Suppose
I should call for a taste, just by way
of trial, of the nectar of your lips;
perhaps I might be disappointed in
that too.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Nectar! nectar! that's
a liquor there's no call for in these
parts. French, I suppose. We keep
no French wines here, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Of true English growth, I
assure you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Then it's odd I should
not know it. We brew all sorts of
wines in this house, and I have lived
here these eighteen years.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Eighteen years? Why, one
would think, child, you kept the bar
<a id='Page_436'></a>before you were born. How old are
you?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> O! sir, I must not tell
my age. They say women and music
should never be dated.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> To guess at this distance,
you can't be much above forty. (<i>Approaching.</i>)
Yet, nearer, I don't think
so much. (<i>Approaching.</i>) By coming
close to some women they look younger
still; but when we come very close
indeed——</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Attempting to kiss her.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Pray, sir, keep your
distance. One would think you wanted
to know one's age as they do horses,
by mark of mouth.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I protest, child, you use me
extremely ill. If you keep me at this
distance, how is it possible you and
I can be ever acquainted?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> And who wants to be
acquainted with you? I want no such
acquaintance, not I. I'm sure you did
not treat Miss Hardcastle, that was
here a while ago, in this obstropalous
manner. I'll warrant me, before her
you looked dashed, and kept bowing
to the ground, and talked, for all the
world, as if you was before a justice of
peace.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Egad! she has hit
it, sure enough. (<i>To her.</i>) In awe of
her, child? Ha! ha! ha! A mere
awkward, squinting thing; no, no. I
find you don't know me. I laughed,
and rallied her a little; but I was unwilling
to be too severe. No, I could
not be too severe, <i>curse me</i>!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> O! then, sir, you are
a favourite, I find, among the ladies.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Yes, my dear, a great favourite.
And yet, hang me, I don't
see what they find in me to follow.
At the ladies' club in town, I'm called
their agreeable Rattle. Rattle, child,
<a id='Page_437'></a>is not my real name, but one I'm

old Miss Biddy Buckskin, and your

the place.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Then it's a very merry

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Yes; as merry as cards,

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> And their agreeable

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I can't but laugh to
think what time they all have for

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) All's well, she
don't laugh at me. (<i>To her.</i> ) Do <i>you</i>
ever work, child?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Ay, sure. There's not
a screen or a quilt in the whole house
but what can bear witness to that.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Odso! Then you must show
me your embroidery. I embroider and
draw patterns myself a little. If you

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> So, madam! So I find <i>this</i>
is your <i>modest</i> lover. This is your
<a id='Page_439'></a>humble admirer, that kept his eyes,
fixed on the ground, and only adored
at humble distance. Kate, Kate, art
thou not ashamed to deceive your
father so?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Never trust me, dear
papa, but he's still the modest man I
first took him for, you'll be convinced
of it as well as I.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> By the hand of my body, I
believe his impudence is infectious!
Didn't I see him seize your hand?
Didn't I see him haul you about like
a milk-maid? and now you talk of his
respect and his modesty, forsooth!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> But if I shortly convince
you of his modesty; that he has
only the faults that will pass off with
time, and the virtues that will improve
with age; I hope you'll forgive him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> The girl would actually make
one run mad; I tell you, I will not be
convinced. I am convinced. He has
scarcely been three hours in the house,
and he has already encroached on all
my prerogatives. You may like his
impudence, and call it modesty; but
my son-in-law, madam, must have very
different qualifications.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Sir, I ask but this
night to convince you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> You shall not have half the
time; for I have thoughts of turning
him out this very hour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Give me that hour,
then, and I hope to satisfy you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Well, an hour let it be then.
But I'll have no trifling with your
father. All fair and open, do you
mind me?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I hope, sir, you have
ever found that I considered your
commands as my pride; for your
kindness is such, that my duty as yet
has been inclination.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> You surprise me! Sir Charles
Marlow expected here this night?
Where have you had your information?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> You may depend upon it.
I just saw his letter to Mr. Hardcastle,
in which he tells him he intends setting
out a few hours after his son.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Then, my Constance, all
must be completed before he arrives.
He knows me; and should he find
me here, would discover my name,
and perhaps my designs, to the rest
of the family.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> The jewels, I hope, are
safe.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Yes, yes. I have sent them
to Marlow, who keeps the keys of our
baggage. In the meantime, I'll go
to prepare matters for our elopement.
I have had the squire's promise of a
fresh pair of horses; and, if I should
not see him again, will write him
further directions.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I wonder what Hastings
could mean by sending me so valuable
a thing as a casket to keep for him,
when he knows the only place I have,
is the seat of a post-coach at an inn-door.—Have
you deposited the casket
with the landlady, as I ordered you?
Have you put it into her own hands?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Serv.</span> Yes, your honour.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_441'></a><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> She said she'd keep it safe,
did she?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Serv.</span> Yes, she said she'd keep it
safe enough; she asked me how I came
by it, and she said she had a great
mind to make me give an account of
myself.</p>

<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div><i>Exit.</i></div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Ha! ha! ha! They're safe,
however. What an unaccountable set
of beings have we got amongst! This
little bar-maid, though, runs in my
head most strangely, and drives out
the absurdities of all the rest of the
family. She's mine, she must be mine,
or I'm greatly mistaken.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Hastings</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Bless me! I quite forgot to
tell her, that I intended to prepare at
the bottom of the garden. Marlow
here, and in spirits too!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Give me joy, George! Crown
me, shadow me with laurels! Well,
George, after all, we modest fellows
don't want for success among the
women.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Some women, you mean.
But what success has your honour's
modesty been crowned with now, that
it grows so insolent upon us?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Didn't you see the tempting,
brisk, lovely, little thing, that runs
about the house, with a bunch of keys
to its girdle?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Well, and what then?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> She's mine, you rogue you.
Such fire, such motion, such eyes,
such lips—but, egad! she would not
let me kiss them though.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_442'></a><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> But are you so sure, so very
sure of her?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Why man, she talked of
showing me her work above-stairs,
and I'm to improve the pattern.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> But how can <i>you</i>, Charles,
go about to rob a woman of her
honour?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Pshaw! pshaw! We all
know the honour of the bar-maid of an
inn. I don't intend to <i>rob</i> her, take
my word for it; there's nothing in
this house I shan't honestly <i>pay</i> for.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> I believe the girl has virtue.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> And if she has, I should be
the last man in the world that would
attempt to corrupt it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> You have taken care, I hope,
of the casket I sent you to lock up?
Is it in safety?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Yes, yes; it's safe enough.
I have taken care of it. But how
could you think the seat of a post-coach,
at an inn-door, a place of safety?
Ah! numb-skull! I have taken better
precautions for you than you did for
yourself.—I have—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> What?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I have sent it to the landlady,
to keep for you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> To the landlady!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> The landlady.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> You did!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I did. She's to be answerable
for its forthcoming, you know.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Yes, she'll bring it forth,
with a witness.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Wasn't I right? I believe
you'll allow that I acted prudently
upon this occasion.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) He must not see
my uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Marl.</i> You seem a little disconcerted
though, methinks. Sure nothing
has happened.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> No, nothing. Never was in
<a id='Page_443'></a>better spirits in all my life. And so
you left it with the landlady, who, no
doubt, very readily undertook the
charge?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Rather too readily. For she
not only kept the casket; but, through
her great precaution, was going to
keep the messenger too. Ha! ha!
ha!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> He! he! he! They are
safe, however.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> As a guinea in a miser'spurse.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) So now all hopes of
fortune are at an end, and we must
set off without it. (<i>To him.</i> ) Well,
Charles, I'll leave you to your meditations
on the pretty bar-maid; and,
he! he! he! may you be as successful
for yourself as you have been for
me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I no longer know my own
house. It's turned all topsy-turvy.
His servants have got drunk already.
I'll bear it no longer; and yet, from
my respect for his father, I'll be calm.
(<i>To him.</i> ) Mr. Marlow, your servant.
I'm your very humble servant.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Bowing low.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Sir, your humble servant.
(<i>Aside.</i>) What's to be the wonder
now?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I believe, sir, you must be
sensible, sir, that no man alive ought
to be more welcome than your father's
son, sir. I hope you think so.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I do, from my soul, sir. I
don't want much entreaty. I generally
make my father's son welcome wherever
he goes.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I believe you do, from my
soul, sir. But though I say nothing
<a id='Page_444'></a>to your own conduct, that of your
servants is insufferable. Their manner
of drinking is setting a very bad example
in this house, I assure you.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I protest, my very good sir,
that's no fault of mine. If they don't
drink as they ought, <i>they</i> are to blame.
I ordered them not to spare the cellar:
<a id='Page_445'></a>I did, I assure you. (<i>To the side scene.</i>)
Here, let one of my servants come up.
(<i>To him.</i>) My positive directions were,
that, as I did not drink myself, they
should make up for my deficiencies
below.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Then, they had your orders
for what they do! I'm satisfied.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> They had, I assure you.
You shall hear from one of themselves.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Servant</span>, <i>drunk</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> You, Jeremy! Come forward,
sirrah! What were my orders?
Were you not told to drink freely, and
call for what you thought fit, for the
good of the house?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) I begin to lose my
patience.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jeremy.</span> Please your honour, liberty
and Fleet-street for ever! Though
I'm but a servant, I'm as good as
another man. I'll drink for no man
before supper, sir, damme! Good
liquor will sit upon a good supper;
but a good supper will not sit upon—(<i>Hiccup.</i>)—upon
my conscience,
sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> You see, my old friend, the
fellow is as drunk as he can possibly
be. I don't know what you'd have
more, unless you'd have the poor
devil soused in a beer-barrel.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Zounds! He'll drive me
distracted if I contain myself any
longer. Mr. Marlow, sir; I have
submitted to your insolence for more
than four hours, and I see no likelihood
of its coming to an end. I'm
now resolved to be master here, sir;
and I desire that you and your
drunken pack may leave my house
directly.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Leave your house?—Sure
you jest, my good friend! What,
<a id='Page_446'></a>when I'm doing what I can to please
you?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I tell you, sir, you don't
please me; so I desire you'll leave my
house.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Sure you cannot be serious!
At this time o'night, and such a
night! You only mean to banter me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I tell you, sir, I'm serious;
and, now that my passions are roused,
I say this house is mine, sir; this
house is mine, and I command you to
leave it directly!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Ha! ha! ha! A puddle in
a storm. I shan't stir a step, I assure
you. (<i>In a serious tone.</i>) This your
house, fellow! It's my house. This
is my house. Mine, while I choose
to stay. What right have you to bid
me leave this house, sir? I never
met with such impudence, curse me,
never in my whole life before.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Nor I, confound me if ever
I did. To come to my house, to call
for what he likes, to turn me out of
my own chair, to insult the family, to
order his servants to get drunk, and
then to tell me, <i>This house is mine, sir</i>.
By all that's impudent, it makes me
laugh. Ha! ha! Pray, sir, (<i>Bantering.</i>)
as you take the house, what think
you of taking the rest of the furniture?
There's a pair of silver candlesticks,
and there's a fire-screen, and here's a
pair of brazen-nosed bellows, perhaps
you may take a fancy to them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Bring me your bill, sir,
bring me your bill, and let's make no
more words about it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> There are a set of prints
too. What think you of the Rake's
Progress for your own apartment?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Bring me your bill, I say;
and I'll leave you and your infernal
house directly.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Then there's a mahogany
<a id='Page_447'></a>table, that you may see your own face
in.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> My bill, I say.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I had forgot the great chair,
for your own particular slumbers, after
a hearty meal.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Zounds! bring me my bill,
I say; and let's hear no more on't.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Young man, young man,
from your father's letter to me, I was
taught to expect a well-bred, modest
man, as a visitor here; but now I find
him no better than a coxcomb, and
a bully. But he will be down here

it's too soon quite to undeceive him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Pray, child, answer me one

may your business in this house be?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> A relation of the

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> What; a poor relation?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Yes, sir; a poor relation,
<a id='Page_448'></a>appointed to keep the keys, and
to see that the guests want nothing in
my power to give them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> That is, you act as the bar-maid
of this inn.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> O law!—What brought
that in your head? One of the best
families in the county keep an inn!
Ha! ha! ha! old Mr. Hardcastle's
house an inn!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Mr. Hardcastle's house? Is
this house Mr. Hardcastle's house,
child?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Ay, sure. Whose else
should it be?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> So then all's out, and I have
been damnably imposed on. O, confound
my stupid head, I shall be
laughed at over the whole town. I
shall be stuck up in caricatura in all
the print-shops: the Dullissimo Maccaroni.
To mistake this house, of all
others, for an inn; and my father's
old friend for an inn-keeper! What
a swaggering puppy must he take me
for! What a silly puppy do I find
myself! There again, may I be
hanged, my dear, but I mistook you
for the bar-maid.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Dear me! dear me!
I'm sure there's nothing in my <i>behaviour</i>
to put me upon a level with
one of that stamp.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Nothing, my dear, nothing.
But I was in for a list of blunders,
and could not help making you a
subscriber. My stupidity saw everything
the wrong way. I mistook
your assiduity for assurance, and your
simplicity for allurement. But it's
over—This house I no more show <i>my</i>
face in.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> I hope, sir, I have
done nothing to disoblige you. I'm
sure I should be sorry to affront any
gentleman who has been so polite, and
<a id='Page_449'></a>said so many civil things to me. I'm
sure I should be sorry (<i>Pretending to
cry.</i>) if he left the family upon my
account. I'm sure I should be sorry,
if people said anything amiss, since I
have no fortune but my character.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) By heaven, she
weeps. This is the first mark of
tenderness I ever had from a modest
woman, and it touches me. (<i>To her.</i>)
Excuse me, my lovely girl, you are the
only part of the family I leave with
reluctance. But to be plain with you,
the difference of our birth, fortune,
and education, make an honourable
connexion impossible; and I can never
harbour a thought of bringing ruin
upon one, whose only fault was being
too lovely.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Generous
man! I now begin to admire him.
(<i>To him.</i>) But I'm sure my family is
as good as Miss Hardcastle's; and
though I'm poor, that's no great misfortune
to a contented mind; and
until this moment, I never thought
that it was bad to want fortune.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> And why now, my pretty
simplicity?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Because it puts me a
distance from one, that if I had a
thousand pound I would give it all
too.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) This simplicity
bewitches me so that if I stay I'm undone.
I must make one bold effort,
and leave her. (<i>To her.</i>) Your partiality
in my favour, my dear, touches
me most sensibly; and were I to live
for myself alone, I could easily fix my
choice. But I owe too much to the
opinion of the world, too much to the
authority of a father, so that—I can
scarcely speak it—it affects me. Farewell.</p>

No, I'd sooner leave my horse in a
pound, than leave you, when you
smile upon one so. Your laugh makes
you so becoming.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Agreeable cousin! Who
can help admiring that natural humour,
that pleasant, broad, red, thoughtless,
(<i>patting his cheek</i>) ah! it's a bold face.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Pretty innocence!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> I'm sure I always loved
cousin Con's hazel eyes, and her pretty
long fingers, that she twists this way
and that, over the haspicholls, like a
parcel of bobbins.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Ah, he would charm
the bird from the tree. I was never
so happy before. My boy takes after
his father, poor Mr. Lumpkin, exactly.
The jewels, my dear Con, shall be
yours incontinently. You shall have
them. Isn't he a sweet boy, my
dear? You shall be married to-morrow,
and we'll put off the rest of
his education, like Mr. Drowsy's
sermons, to a fitter opportunity.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Diggory</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Digg.</span> Where's the 'squire? I have
got a letter for your worship.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Give it to my mamma. She

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Digg.</span> I had orders to deliver it
into your own hands.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Who does it come from?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Digg.</span> Your worship mun ask that
o' the letter itself.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> I could wish to know,
<a id='Page_452'></a>though (<i>turning the letter and gazing
on it</i>).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Undone, undone!
A letter to him from Hastings.
I know the hand. If my aunt sees it,
we are ruined for ever. I'll keep her
employed a little if I can. (<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs.
Hardcastle</span>.) But I have not told
you, madam, of my cousin's smart
answer just now to Mr. Marlow. We
so laughed—You must know, madam—this
way a little; for he must not
hear us.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>They confer.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> (<i>Still gazing.</i>) A damn'd
cramp piece of penmanship, as ever I
saw in my life. I can read your printhand
very well. But here there are such
handles, and shanks, and dashes, that
one can scarce tell the head from the
tail. <i>To Anthony Lumpkin, Esq.</i> It's
very odd, I can read the outside of my
letters, where my own name is, well
enough. But when I come to open it,
it is all—buzz. That's hard, very
hard; for the inside of the letter is
always the cream of the correspondence.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Ha! ha! ha! Very
well, very well. And so my son was
too hard for the philosopher.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Yes, madam; but you
must hear the rest, madam. A little
more this way, or he may hear us.
You'll hear how he puzzled him again.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> He seems strangely
puzzled now himself, methinks.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> (<i>Still gazing.</i>) A damned up
and down hand, as if it was disguised
in liquor. (<i>Reading.</i>) <i>Dear Sir</i>, Ay,
that's that. Then there's an <i>M</i>, and
a <i>T</i>, and <i>S</i>; but whether the next be
an <i>izzard</i> or an <i>R</i>, confound me, I
cannot tell.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> What's that, my dear.
Can I give you any assistance?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Pray, aunt, let me read
<a id='Page_453'></a>it. Nobody reads a cramp hand
better than I. (<i>Twitching the letter
from her.</i>) Do you know who it is
from?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Can't tell, except from Dick
Ginger, the feeder.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Ay, so it is. (<i>Pretending
to read.</i>) Dear 'Squire, Hoping
that you're in health, as I am at this
present. The gentlemen of the Shake-bag
club has cut the gentlemen of
Goose green quite out of feather.
The odds—um—odd battle—um—long
fighting—um—Here, here; it's
all about cocks, and fighting: it's of
no consequence; here, put it up, put
it up.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Thrusting the crumpled letter upon him.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> But I tell you, miss, it's of
all the consequence in the world. I
would not lose the rest of it for a
guinea. Here, mother, do you make
it out. Of no consequence!</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Giving</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Hardcastle</span> <i>the letter</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> How's this? (<i>Reads.</i>)
Dear 'Squire, I'm now waiting for
Miss Neville, with a post-chaise and
pair, at the bottom of the garden, but
I find my horses yet unable to perform
the journey. I expect you'll assist us
with a pair of fresh horses, as you
promised. Dispatch is necessary, as
the <i>hag</i> (ay the hag), your mother, will
otherwise suspect us. Yours, Hastings.
Grant me patience. I shall
run distracted. My rage chokes me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> I hope, madam, you'll
suspend your resentment for a few
moments, and not impute to me any
impertinence, or sinister design that
belongs to another.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> (<i>Curtseying very low.</i>)
Fine-spoken madam, you are most
miraculously polite and engaging, and
quite the very pink of courtesy and
circumspection, madam. (<i>Changing</i>
<a id='Page_454'></a><i>her tone.</i> ) And you, you great ill-fashioned
oaf, with scarce sense enough
to keep your mouth shut. Were you
too joined against me? But I'll
defeat all your plots in a moment. As
for you, madam, since you have got a
pair of fresh horses ready, it would be
cruel to disappoint them. So, if you
please, instead of running away with
your spark, prepare, this very moment,
to run off with <i>me</i>. Your old aunt
Pedigree will keep you secure, I'll
warrant me. You too, sir, may
mount your horse, and guard us upon
the way. Here, Thomas, Roger, Diggory,
I'll show you, that I wish you
better than you do yourselves.</p>

such a stupid fool, and after all the

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> By the laws, miss, it was
your own cleverness, and not my stupidity,
that did your business. You

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> So, I have been finely used

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> And there, sir, is the
gentleman to whom we all owe every
obligation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> What can I say to him, a
mere boy, an idiot, whose ignorance
and age are a protection?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> A poor contemptible booby,
that would but disgrace correction.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Yet with cunning and
malice enough to make himself merry
with all our embarrassments.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> An insensible cub.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Replete with tricks and
mischief.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Baw! damme, but I'll fight
you both, one after the other,——with
baskets.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> As for him, he's below resentment.
But your conduct, Mr.
Hastings, requires an explanation.
You knew of my mistakes, yet would
not undeceive me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Tortured as I am with my
own disappointments, is this a time
for explanations? It is not friendly,
Mr. Marlow.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> But, sir——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Mr. Marlow, we never

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> And the reserve with
which I suppose he treated all your

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> And yet he might have seen
something in me above a common inn-keeper
too.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> Yes, Dick, but he
mistook you for an uncommon inn-keeper,
ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Well, I'm in too good spirits
to think of anything but joy. Yes,
my dear friend, this union of our families
will make our personal friendships
hereditary; and though my daughter's
fortune is but small——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> Why, Dick, will you
talk of fortune to <i>me</i>? My son is
possessed of more than a competence
already, and can want nothing but a
good and virtuous girl to share his
happiness and increase it. If they like
each other, as you say they do——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> <i>If</i>, man! I tell you they
<i>do</i> like each other. My daughter as
good as told me so.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> But girls are apt to
flatter themselves, you know.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I saw him grasp her hand
in the warmest manner myself; and
here he comes to put you out of your

<p class='c016'><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Marlow</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I come, sir, once more, to
ask pardon for my strange conduct.
I can scarce reflect on my insolence
without confusion.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Tut, boy, a trifle. You take
<a id='Page_460'></a>it too gravely. An hour or two's
laughing with my daughter will set all
to rights again.—She'll never like you
the worse for it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Sir, I shall be always proud
of her approbation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Approbation is but a cold
word, Mr. Marlow: if I am not deceived,
you have something more than approbation
thereabouts. You take me.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Really, sir, I have not that
happiness.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Come boy, I'm an old fellow,
and know what's what, as well as you
that are younger. I know what has
passed between you; but mum.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Sure, sir, nothing has passed
between us, but the most profound
respect on my side, and the most
distant reserve on hers. You don't
think, sir, that my impudence has
been passed upon all the rest of the
family.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Impudence! No, I don't
say that—Not quite impudence—Though
girls like to be played with,
and rumpled a little too sometimes.
But she has told no tales I assure you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I never gave her the slightest
cause.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Well, well, I like modesty
in its place well enough. But this is
over-acting, young gentleman. You
<i>may</i> be open. Your father and I will
like you the better for it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> May I die, sir, if I ever——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I tell you, she don't dislike
you; and as I'm sure you like her——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> Dear sir—I protest, sir——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I see no reason why you
should not be joined as fast as the
parson can tie you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> But hear me, sir——</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Your father approves the
match, I admire it, every moment's
delay will be doing mischief, so——</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_461'></a><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> But why won't you hear
me? By all that's just and true, I
never gave Miss Hardcastle the slightest
mark of my attachment, or even
the most distant hint to suspect me of
affection. We had but one interview,
and that was formal, modest and uninteresting.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>). This fellow's formal
modest impudence is beyond bearing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> And you never
grasped her hand, or made any protestations?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> As Heaven is my witness, I
came down in obedience to your commands.
I saw the lady without
emotion, and parted without reluctance.
I hope you'll exact no further
proofs of my duty, nor prevent me
from leaving a house in which I suffer
so many mortifications.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> The question is very

unreserved sincerity, I think he has.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Sir Charles</span>.) You see.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> And pray, madam,

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Yes, sir, several.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_462'></a><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> But did he profess
any attachment?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> A lasting one.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> Did he talk of love?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Much, sir.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> Amazing! and all
this formally?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Formally.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Now, my friend, I hope you
are satisfied?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> And how did he behave,
madam?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> As most professed admirers
do. Said some civil things of
my face: talked much of his want of
merit, and the greatness of mine;
mentioned his heart; gave a short
tragedy speech, and ended with pretended
rapture.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> Now I'm perfectly
convinced, indeed. I know his conversation
among women to be modest
and submissive. This forward, canting,
ranting manner by no means describes
him, and I am confident he
never sat for the picture.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Then what, sir, if I
should convince you to your face of
my sincerity? If you and my papa,
in about half-an-hour, will place yourselves
behind that screen, you shall
hear him declare his passion to me in
person.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> Agreed. And if I

night, by-the-by, is cursedly tiresome.
It has shook me worse than the basket
of a stage-coach.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> But how? Where did you
leave your fellow travellers? Are they
in safety! Are they housed?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Five-and-twenty miles in two
hours and a half is no such bad driving.
The poor beasts have smoked
for it. Rabbet me, but I'd rather ride
forty miles after a fox, than ten with
such <i>varment</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Well, but where have you
left the ladies? I die with impatience.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Left them? Why where
should I leave them but where I found
them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> This is a riddle.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Riddle me this, then. What's
that goes round the house, and round
the house and never touches the
house?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> I'm still astray.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Why that's it, mon. I have
led them astray. By jingo, there's not
a pond or slough within five miles of
the place, but they can tell the taste of.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Ha, ha, ha! I understand:
you took them in a round, while they
supposed themselves going forward.
And so you have at last brought them
home again.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_464'></a><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> You shall hear. I first took
them down Feather-bed-lane, where
we stuck fast in the mud. I then
rattled them crack over the stones of
Up-and-down Hill—I then introduced
them to the gibbet, on Heavy-tree
Heath; and from that, with a circumbendibus,
I fairly lodged them in the
horse-pond at the bottom of the
garden.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> But no accident, I hope.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> No, no. Only mother is
confoundedly frightened. She thinks
herself forty miles off. She's sick of
the journey, and the cattle can scarce
crawl. So if your own horses be
ready, you may whip off with cousin,
and I'll be bound that no soul here
can budge a foot to follow you.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> My dear friend, how can I
be grateful?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Ay, now it's dear friend,
noble 'squire. Just now, it was all
idiot, cub, and run me through the
guts. Damn <i>your</i> way of fighting, I
say. After we take a knock in this
part of the country, we kiss and be
friends. But, if you had run me
through the guts, then I should be
dead, and you might go kiss the hangman.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> The rebuke is just. But I
must hasten to relieve Miss Neville;
if you keep the old lady employed, I
promise to take care of the young one.</p>

<a id='Page_465'></a>laid us against the quickset hedge, has
done my business.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Alack, mamma, it was all
your own fault. You would be for
running away by night, without knowing
one inch of the way.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> I wish we were at
home again. I never met so many accidents
in so short a journey. Drenched
in the mud, overturned in a ditch,
stuck fast in a slough, jolted to a
jelly, and at last to lose our way!
Whereabouts do you think we are,
Tony?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> By my guess we should be
upon Crackskull Common, about forty
miles from home.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> O lud! O lud! the

We only want a robbery to make a

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> But if you talked to yourself,

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> (<i>Running forward from

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> (<i>Kneeling.</i>) Take compassion

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Mr. Hardcastle, as I'm

who, my dear, could have expected to

you to follow us?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Sure, Dorothy, you have not
lost your wits? So far from home,
when you are within forty yards of
your own door? (<i>To him.</i>) This is
one of your old tricks, you graceless

know the gate, and the mulberry-tree?
and don't you remember the horse-pond,

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Yes, I shall remember
the horse-pond as long as I live: I
have caught my death in it. (<i>To</i>
<span class='sc'>Tony</span>.) And is it to you, you graceless

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> My dear Constance, why will
you deliberate thus? If we delay a
moment, all is lost for ever. Pluck
up a little resolution, and we shall
soon be out of the reach of her malignity.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> I find it impossible.
My spirits are so sunk with the agitations
I have suffered, that I am
unable to face any new danger. Two
or three years' patience will at last
crown us with happiness.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> Such a tedious delay is worse
than inconstancy. Let us fly, my
charmer. Let us date our happiness
from this very moment. Perish fortune.
Love and content will increase
what we possess, beyond a monarch's
revenue. Let me prevail.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> No, Mr. Hastings; no.
<a id='Page_469'></a>Prudence once more comes to my
relief, and I will obey its dictates.
In the moment of passion, fortune
may be despised; but it ever produces
a lasting repentance. I am resolved
to apply to Mr. Hardcastle's compassion
and justice for redress.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hast.</span> But though he had the will,
he has not the power, to relieve you.</p>

nor did I, till this moment, know the
pain I feel in the separation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> (<i>In her own natural
manner.</i>) I believe these sufferings
cannot be very great, sir, which you
can so easily remove. A day or two
longer, perhaps, might lessen your uneasiness,
by showing the little value of
what you now think proper to regret.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) This girl every moment
improves upon me. (<i>To her.</i>) It
must not be, madam. I have already
<a id='Page_470'></a>trifled too long with my heart. My
very pride begins to submit to my
passion. The disparity of education
and fortune, the anger of a parent,
and the contempt of my equals, begin
to lose their weight, and nothing can
restore me to myself, but this painful
effort of resolution.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Then go, sir. I'll
urge nothing more to detain you.
Though my family be as good as hers
you came down to visit; and my education,
I hope, not inferior, what are
these advantages, without equal affluence?
I must remain contented with
the slight approbation of imputed
merit; I must have only the mockery
of your addresses, while all your
serious aims are fixed on fortune.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Ay, ay, make no noise. I'll

at last.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> By heavens, madam, fortune
was ever my smallest consideration.
Your beauty at first caught my eye;
for who could see that without emotion?
But every moment that I converse
with you, steals in some new
grace, heightens the picture, and gives
it stronger expression. What at first
seemed rustic plainness, now appears
refined simplicity. What seemed forward
assurance, now strikes me as the
result of courageous innocence and
conscious virtue.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> What can it mean?
He amazes me!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> I told you how it would be.
Hush!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> I am now determined to
stay, madam; and I have too good an
<a id='Page_471'></a>opinion of my father's discernment,
when he sees you, to doubt his approbation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> No, Mr. Marlow, I
will not, cannot detain you. Do you
think I could suffer a connexion in
which there is the smallest room for
repentance? Do you think I would
take the mean advantage of a transient
passion, to load you with confusion?
Do you think I could ever relish that
happiness which was acquired by lessening
yours?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> By all that's good, I can
have no happiness but what's in your
power to grant me. Nor shall I ever
feel repentance, but in not having seen
your merits before. I will stay, even
contrary to your wishes; and though
you should persist to shun me, I will
make my respectful assiduities atone
for the levity of my past conduct.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Hard.</span> Sir, I must entreat
you'll desist. As our acquaintance
began, so let it end, in indifference.
I might have given an hour or two to
levity; but seriously, Mr. Marlow, do
you think I could ever submit to a
connexion where <i>I</i> must appear mercenary,
and <i>you</i> imprudent? Do you
think I could ever catch at the confident
addresses of a secure admirer?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Marl.</span> (<i>Kneeling.</i>) Does this look
like security? Does this look like
confidence? No, madam; every moment
that shows me your merit, only
serves to increase my diffidence and
confusion. Here let me continue—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles.</span> I can hold it no
longer. Charles, Charles, how hast
thou deceived me! Is this your indifference,
your uninteresting conversation?</p>

let my present confusion be my punishment.
We are now come back, to

By her father's consent, I
first paid her my addresses, and our
passions were first founded on duty.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss Nev.</span> Since his death, I have
been obliged to stoop to dissimulation
to avoid oppression. In an hour of
levity, I was ready even to give up
my fortune to secure my choice. But
I am now recovered from the delusion,
and hope, from your tenderness, what
is denied me from a nearer connexion.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hard.</span> Pshaw, pshaw! this is

<a id='Page_475'></a>Do you refuse this lady's hand whom

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> What signifies my refusing?
You know I can't refuse her till I'm of
age, father.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> While I thought concealing
your age, boy, was likely to conduce to
your improvement, I concurred with
your mother's desire, to keep it secret.
But since I find she turns it to a
wrong use, I must now declare, you
have been of age these three months.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Of age! Am I of age,
father?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> Above three months.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tony.</span> Then you'll see the first use
I'll make of my liberty. (<i>Taking</i> <span class='sc'>Miss

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hard.</span> (<i>Joining their hands.</i>) And I
say so too. And, Mr. Marlow, if she
makes as good a wife as she has a
daughter, I don't believe you'll ever
repent your bargain. So now to
supper. To-morrow we shall gather
all the poor of the parish about us;
and the mistakes of the night shall be
crowned with a merry morning. So,
boy, take her; and as you have been
mistaken in the mistress, my wish is,
that you may never be mistaken in
the wife.</p>

<p class='c016'><a id='Page_476'></a>EPILOGUE,</p>

<p class='c016'>BY DR. GOLDSMITH.</p>
<p class='c017'>SPOKEN BY MRS. BULKLEY,</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Well, having stoop'd to conquer with success,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gain'd a husband without aid from dress,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still, as a bar-maid, I could wish it too,</div>
      <div class='line'>As I have conquer'd him to conquer you:</div>
      <div class='line'>And let me say, for all your resolution,</div>
      <div class='line'>That pretty bar-maids have done execution.</div>
      <div class='line'>Our life is all a play, composed to please:</div>
      <div class='line'>"We have our exits and our entrances."</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_477'></a>The first act shows the simple country maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Harmless and young, of everything afraid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Blushes when hired, and, with unmeaning action,</div>
      <div class='line'>"I hopes as how to give you satisfaction."</div>
      <div class='line'>Her second act displays a livelier scene,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The unblushing bar-maid of a country inn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who whisks about the house, at market caters,</div>
      <div class='line'>Talks loud, coquets the guests, and scolds the waiters.</div>
      <div class='line'>Next the scene shifts to town, and there she soars,</div>
      <div class='line'>The chop-house toast of ogling <i>connoisseurs</i>:</div>
      <div class='line'>On 'squires and cuts she there displays her arts,</div>
      <div class='line'>And on the gridiron broils her lovers' hearts;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as she smiles, her triumphs to complete,</div>
      <div class='line'>E'en common-councilmen forget to eat.</div>
      <div class='line'>The fourth act shows her wedded to the 'squire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And madam now begins to hold it higher;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pretends to taste, at operas cries <i>caro!</i></div>
      <div class='line'>And quits her Nancy Dawson for Che Faro:</div>
      <div class='line'>Doats upon dancing, and, in all her pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Swims round the room, the Heinelle of Cheapside:</div>
      <div class='line'>Ogles and leers with artificial skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till, having lost in age the power to kill,</div>
      <div class='line'>She sits all night at cards, and ogles at spadille.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such through our lives the eventful history—</div>
      <div class='line'>The fifth and last act still remains for me:</div>
      <div class='line'>The bar-maid now for your protection prays,</div>
      <div class='line'>Turns female barrister, and pleads for bays.</div>
